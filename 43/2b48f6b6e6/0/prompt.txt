# GitHub PR Review

## Overview

Technical mechanics for GitHub PR review workflows via `gh` CLI. Covers fetching review comments, replying to threads, creating/updating PRs.

**Companion skill:** For *how to evaluate* feedback, see `superpowers:receiving-code-review`. This skill covers *how to interact* with GitHub.

**Security:** Use fine-grained PAT with minimal permissions.

## Setup (One-Time)

### Fine-Grained PAT

Create at github.com -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens:

| Permission | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Pull requests | Read & Write |
| Contents | Read |

**Can't:** Delete repos, push code, delete branches, manage settings.

### Configure & Allowlist

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="github_pat_xxxx"
```

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(gh repo view:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr view:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr create:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr ready:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr edit:*)",
      "Bash(gh api repos/*/*/pulls/*/comments:*)",
      "Bash(gh api repos/*/*/pulls/*/comments/*/replies:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Quick Reference

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Get owner/repo | `gh repo view --json owner,name -q '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'` |
| Get PR number | `gh pr view --json number -q .number` |
| Get PR author | `gh pr view --json author -q .author.login` |
| Fetch all review comments | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments --paginate` |
| Get single comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}` |
| Reply to comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -f body="msg"` |
| Create PR | `gh pr create --title "T" --body "B" [--draft]` |
| Mark ready | `gh pr ready [number]` |
| Convert to draft | `gh pr ready --undo [number]` |
| Edit PR | `gh pr edit [number] --title "T" --body "B"` |

## Workflow: Respond to PR Review

### 1. Get repo info and PR details

```bash
owner_repo=$(gh repo view --json owner,name -q '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"')
pr_number=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
pr_author=$(gh pr view --json author -q .author.login)
```

### 2. Fetch and analyze threads

```bash
# Fetch all comments and group into threads, showing last author per thread
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments --paginate | jq 'sort_by([.in_reply_to_id // .id, .created_at]) | group_by(.in_reply_to_id // .id) | map({thread_id: (.[0].in_reply_to_id // .[0].id), path: .[0].path, line: (.[0].line // .[0].original_line), last_author: .[-1].user.login, last_body: .[-1].body[0:100], count: length})'
```

### 3. Filter to threads needing response

```bash
# Filter to threads where last_author != PR author
# Note: Use '| not' instead of '!=' to avoid shell escaping issues with !
... | jq --arg author "$pr_author" '[.[] | select(.last_author == $author | not)]'
```

For each thread needing response:
- Read the comment + file/line context
- Apply `superpowers:receiving-code-review` skill for evaluation
- Fix code and/or reply to thread

### 4. Commit fixes and push
- run the build, tests, linting as required
- commit the changes, noting the commit sha
- push the changes so they're visible
- We need to do this FIRST so we have the commit shas to put into the replies to the pr review

### 5. Re-fetch comment IDs (if rebased)

**Important:** If you rebased or force-pushed, comment IDs may have changed. Re-fetch the comment threads before replying:

```bash
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments --paginate | jq '...'
```

### 6. Reply to a thread

```bash
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123. [description of fix]"
```

### 7. Summarize and finish

After all threads addressed, ask if ready to mark PR ready for review.

**Note:** REST API doesn't expose "resolved" status. We infer "done" when PR author made last comment in thread.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Broad PAT permissions | Use fine-grained PAT with only Pull requests + Contents |
| Missing pagination | Always use `--paginate` for comment fetching |
| Top-level reply | Use `/comments/{id}/replies` endpoint, not `/comments` |
| Re-responding to threads | Skip threads where PR author made last comment |
| Forgetting to reply after fix | Always reply to confirm the fix was made |
| jq `!=` fails with shell error | Use `select(.x == "y" \| not)` instead of `select(.x != "y")` |
| 404 on reply after rebase | Comment IDs change after force-push/rebase. Re-fetch comments before replying |

ehh, in this _specific_ gemini case, can we not get the sessionId off the hook payload?

(also I thought we'd removed the concept of entireSessionId?)

also have a look at some of the open PRs, there are some gemini specific ones that may be related to this...

---

hmm, I feel like this stdin consumption is limiting. let's check the other PRs first

---

I mean this is already the "everything else PR" so why the heck not.

Is there any reason we don't parse the stdin on entry? is there some streaming aspect?

---

where are all the callers of commitWithMetadataGemini?

---

...why does the method exist at all?

---

if we did that do we stuff up the other PRs?

---

hmm, 162 is already generally affected by our state machine stuff no?

---

yeah let's do it

---

yes - commit, push, reply to the PR review comment.

Then, let's pop a comment into #162 saying that we probably don't need it any more given this PR stack? (also reference the specific changes we've made to the structure to inline)

<bash-input>git pull --rebase</bash-input>

I've still got a shadow, no condensation commit

---

it was supposed to, yeah? 🤣

---

okay, so what have we got - there's a few things floating around yeah?

---

also we may have an entire reset bug as I called one a little while ago...

though that may not clear out session files...add it to an investigate list

---

is 1 technically part of PR #170?

---

or #172?

---

write a comment in #172, I'll handle it over there

---

okay, fix is pushed, let's update from parent branch alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks; there's a merge conflict

---

we added that missing test in this PR yeah?

---

fix it up

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial merge conflicts from parent branch** - User had merge conflicts from `alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks`. Working tree was already clean, but there were compile errors from `InitializeSession` signature change (3 args → 4 args with new `agentType agent.AgentType` parameter).

2. **Fixed InitializeSession call sites** in `phase_prepare_commit_msg_test.go` - Added `agent` import and changed calls from `s.InitializeSession(sessionID, "Claude Code", "")` to `s.InitializeSession(sessionID, agent.AgentTypeClaudeCode, "/tmp/transcript.jsonl", "")`. User corrected that I initially passed `"Claude Code"` as the transcriptPath (3rd arg) when it should be a path. Changed to `/tmp/transcript.jsonl`.

3. **Pushed, then second merge from parent** - Parent had new commit `eafc9512`. Merged, resolved same test file conflict by taking theirs (parent already fixed with `""`).

4. **PR review on #174** - Fetched review comments. All 12 human threads addressed by PR author. One cursor[bot] thread about `FindMostRecentSession` potentially marking wrong session in concurrent scenarios.

5. **User identified stdin consumption issue** - The `handleGeminiSessionEnd()` calls `commitWithMetadataGemini()` which consumes stdin, then falls back to `FindMostRecentSession()` to find the session ID. User asked if we can get sessionId from hook payload. Also noted `entireSessionId` naming should have been removed.

6. **Checked open Gemini PRs** - #167 (transcript position tracking), #162 (skip checkpoint on /quit), #158 (token usage). None address the stdin issue.

7. **Inlined `commitWithMetadataGemini` into `handleGeminiSessionEnd`** - Single caller, no reason to exist. Parse stdin once at top, use `ctx.sessionID` throughout. Removed `FindMostRecentSession()` fallback and `entireSessionID` variable. Committed as `4afd4e47`.

8. **Commented on PR #162** - Noted it's likely superseded by ENT-221 stack (state machine handles the duplicate checkpoint scenario, and `commitWithMetadataGemini` no longer exists).

9. **PR review round 2** - New cursor[bot] comment about redundant `PhaseFromString(string(state.Phase))` in `activeSessionsOnCurrentHead`. Fixed by simplifying to `state.Phase.IsActive()`. Committed as `9a4894a7`.

10. **Testing the build** - User provided detailed logs showing several issues:
    - Stale sessions with empty phase (`446f6b3c`, `53a5d919`, `bc8f40a7`) being processed on every commit, transitioning `from="" to=idle`
    - Missing stop hook in logs for session `28c304f6`
    - Wrong session's session-end appearing in `28c304f6`'s log

11. **Debugging session** - Traced through:
    - `findSessionsForWorktree` returns ALL sessions regardless of phase
    - Post-commit updates `LastInteractionTime` on stale sessions
    - `initHookLogging()` uses `FindMostRecentSession()` for log file routing, which gets poisoned by stale session timestamps
    - Stop hook DID fire (confirmed by Claude Code transcript) but logs went to wrong file
    - **Critical bug**: `transitionSessionTurnEnd()` drops `ActionCondense` return value - deferred condensation (ACTIVE_COMMITTED → IDLE) never fires

12. **Task list created** with 4 items:
    - #1: Fix deferred condensation (critical, data loss)
    - #2: Filter stale sessions in findSessionsForWorktree
    - #3: Fix log file routing
    - #4: Investigate entire reset not cleaning session state files

13. **Bug #1 attribution** - User pointed out it belongs in PR #172 (phase-aware PostCommit), not #170. Commented on #172 with full bug report referencing ENT-250 (ActionHandler interface issue).

14. **Fix pushed in #172** - User pushed fix, we merged from parent. Conflict in `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` - took theirs (the TurnEnd action dispatch fix with `TurnEndHandler`).

15. **Integration test failure** - `TestShadow_CommitBeforeStop` failing because Phase 5 expected `StepCount == 0` after commit-triggered condensation, but now Phase 4's TurnEnd condensation already fires (the fix from #172). Updated test to verify condensation in Phase 4 instead of Phase 5.

Key files modified:
- `cmd/entire/cli/hooks_geminicli_handlers.go` - Inlined `commitWithMetadataGemini`, removed `FindMostRecentSession` usage
- `cmd/entire/cli/strategy/phase_prepare_commit_msg_test.go` - Fixed `InitializeSession` calls
- `cmd/entire/cli/reset.go` - Removed redundant `PhaseFromString` round-trip
- `cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/phase_transitions_test.go` - Updated for TurnEnd condensation behavior
- `cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` - Merged from parent (TurnEnd action dispatch fix)

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Resolve merge conflicts from parent branch `alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks` into `alex/ent-221-cleanup-and-sessions-fix` (PR #174, the 5th PR in the ENT-221 stack)
   - Handle PR review comments on #174
   - Debug and fix issues found during live testing of the build
   - Inline `commitWithMetadataGemini()` to fix stdin consumption architecture
   - Comment on related PRs (#162, #172) about discovered bugs
   - Fix integration test `TestShadow_CommitBeforeStop` broken by parent branch's TurnEnd condensation fix

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Session Phase State Machine**: Phases (ACTIVE, ACTIVE_COMMITTED, IDLE, ENDED) with events (TurnStart, TurnEnd, GitCommit, SessionStart, SessionStop) and actions (ActionCondense, ActionMigrateShadowBranch, etc.)
   - **Deferred Condensation**: When a commit happens during ACTIVE phase → ACTIVE_COMMITTED, condensation is deferred until TurnEnd (stop hook)
   - **Shadow branches**: `entire/<commit-hash[:7]>-<worktreeHash[:6]>` for temporary checkpoint storage
   - **`entire/sessions` branch**: Permanent metadata storage after condensation
   - **`FindMostRecentSession()`**: Heuristic that returns session with most recent `LastInteractionTime` — used for log file routing, prone to poisoning
   - **`initHookLogging()`**: Routes hook logs to a session's log file based on `FindMostRecentSession()` — fragile in multi-session scenarios
   - **`transitionSessionTurnEnd()`**: Fires EventTurnEnd, was dropping ActionCondense return value (critical bug fixed in #172)
   - **`TurnEndHandler` interface**: New interface from #172 fix allowing strategy to dispatch actions on TurnEnd
   - **ENT-250**: Planned `ActionHandler` interface refactor to prevent silent action drops at compile time
   - **Strategy pattern**: `ManualCommitStrategy` and `AutoCommitStrategy` implementing `Strategy` interface
   - **`InitializeSession` signature**: Changed from `(sessionID, transcriptPath, userPrompt)` to `(sessionID, agentType, transcriptPath, userPrompt)`

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_geminicli_handlers.go`**
     - Core change: inlined `commitWithMetadataGemini()` into `handleGeminiSessionEnd()`
     - Eliminated `FindMostRecentSession()` fallback and `entireSessionID` variable
     - Stdin now parsed once at entry via `parseGeminiSessionEnd()`
     - `commitWithMetadataGemini()` function deleted entirely (was single-caller)
     ```go
     func handleGeminiSessionEnd() error {
         if skip, branchName := ShouldSkipOnDefaultBranchForStrategy(); skip {
             fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Entire: skipping on branch '%s' - create a feature branch to use Entire tracking\n", branchName)
             return nil
         }
         // Parse stdin once upfront — all subsequent steps use ctx.sessionID
         ctx, err := parseGeminiSessionEnd()
         if err != nil {
             if errors.Is(err, ErrSessionSkipped) {
                 return nil
             }
             return fmt.Errorf("failed to parse session-end input: %w", err)
         }
         logCtx := logging.WithComponent(context.Background(), "hooks")
         logging.Info(logCtx, "session-end",
             slog.String("hook", "session-end"),
             slog.String("hook_type", "agent"),
             slog.String("session_id", ctx.sessionID),
         )
         // Best-effort commit of any uncommitted changes
         if err := setupGeminiSessionDir(ctx); err != nil {
             fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Warning: failed to setup session dir: %v\n", err)
         } else if err := extractGeminiMetadata(ctx); err != nil {
             fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Warning: failed to extract metadata: %v\n", err)
         } else if err := commitGeminiSession(ctx); err != nil {
             fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Warning: failed to commit metadata: %v\n", err)
         }
         // Mark session as ended using the parsed session ID
         if err := markSessionEnded(ctx.sessionID); err != nil {
             fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Warning: failed to mark session ended: %v\n", err)
         }
         return nil
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/phase_prepare_commit_msg_test.go`**
     - Fixed `InitializeSession` calls after `agentType` parameter addition
     - Added `agent` import, changed 4 call sites
     ```go
     s.InitializeSession(sessionID, agent.AgentTypeClaudeCode, "/tmp/transcript.jsonl", "")
     ```
     - Later merged from parent which had `""` instead of `"/tmp/transcript.jsonl"` — took theirs

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/reset.go`**
     - Removed redundant phase string round-trip in `activeSessionsOnCurrentHead`
     ```go
     // Before:
     phase := session.PhaseFromString(string(state.Phase))
     if phase.IsActive() {
     // After:
     if state.Phase.IsActive() {
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/phase_transitions_test.go`**
     - Updated `TestShadow_CommitBeforeStop` for new TurnEnd condensation behavior
     - Removed Phase 5 (redundant "verify condensation on next commit" since Phase 4 TurnEnd now condenses)
     - Added condensation verification directly after Phase 4's stop
     - Updated test doc comment to describe ACTIVE_COMMITTED + TurnEnd → IDLE + ActionCondense

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go`**
     - Merged from parent: `transitionSessionTurnEnd()` now dispatches remaining actions via `TurnEndHandler` interface instead of dropping them
     - This was the fix for the critical deferred condensation bug (task #1)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_git_cmd.go`** (read-only, key discovery)
     - `initHookLogging()` at line 62 uses `FindMostRecentSession()` to route logs — root cause of log routing bug
     - Shared by both git hooks and agent hooks via `PersistentPreRunE`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_hooks.go`** (read-only, key discovery)
     - `PostCommit()` iterates all sessions from `findSessionsForWorktree()` — no phase filtering
     - New `HandleTurnEnd()` and `handleTurnEndCondense()` methods from parent branch fix

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_session.go`** (read-only, key discovery)
     - `findSessionsForWorktree()` returns ALL sessions matching worktree — no phase filter, root cause of stale session processing

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/session/phase.go`** (read-only, key discovery)
     - `Transition()` normalizes empty phase to `PhaseIdle` via `PhaseFromString`
     - `ACTIVE_COMMITTED + TurnEnd → IDLE` emits `[ActionCondense, ActionUpdateLastInteraction]`

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **`InitializeSession` compile errors after merge**: Function signature changed from 3 to 4 args. Fixed by adding `agent.AgentTypeClaudeCode` parameter and `agent` import. User corrected that I initially passed `"Claude Code"` as `transcriptPath` — should be a path-like value.
   - **Push rejected (remote has new commits)**: Resolved with `git pull --rebase`.
   - **Integration test `TestShadow_CommitBeforeStop` failing**: `StepCount should be 0 after condensation, got 1`. Root cause: test was written before Phase 4's TurnEnd condensation fix landed. Phase 5 expected condensation on commit, but it already happened on TurnEnd. Fixed by moving condensation verification to Phase 4 and removing redundant Phase 5.
   - **Stale sessions processed on every commit**: `findSessionsForWorktree()` returns all sessions. Pre-state-machine sessions with empty phase get `LastInteractionTime` updated, poisoning `FindMostRecentSession()`. Not yet fixed (task #2).
   - **Log routing to wrong session**: `initHookLogging()` uses `FindMostRecentSession()` which was poisoned by stale session timestamps. Not yet fixed (task #3).
   - **Deferred condensation never fired**: `transitionSessionTurnEnd()` ignored return value from `TransitionAndLog()`. Fixed in parent branch #172.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Diagnosed complex multi-session bug through log analysis: stale sessions → poisoned timestamps → wrong log routing → missing stop hook output → appeared as if stop hook never fired
   - Confirmed stop hook DID fire via Claude Code's raw transcript JSON (`hook_progress` and `stop_hook_summary` events)
   - Identified that `commitWithMetadataGemini()` was a pointless single-caller indirection causing stdin consumption issues
   - Connected the deferred condensation bug to ENT-250 (ActionHandler interface for compile-time exhaustive action dispatch)
   - Identified PR #162 as likely superseded by the state machine work in ENT-221 stack

6. All User Messages:
   - "got merge conflicts from parent alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks"
   - "technically the third argument here is the transcriptPath..."
   - "continue merge, then push"
   - "and /github-pr-review"
   - "okay, now /github-pr-review"
   - "ehh, in this _specific_ gemini case, can we not get the sessionId off the hook payload? (also I thought we'd removed the concept of entireSessionId?) also have a look at some of the open PRs, there are some gemini specific ones that may be related to this..."
   - "hmm, I feel like this stdin consumption is limiting. let's check the other PRs first"
   - "...why does the method exist at all?"
   - "if we did that do we stuff up the other PRs?"
   - "hmm, 162 is already generally affected by our state machine stuff no?"
   - "yeah let's do it"
   - "or something descriptive? but yeah let's not worry too much about it as long as it doesn't add confusion" (rejected empty string, accepted `/tmp/transcript.jsonl`)
   - "yes - commit, push, reply to the PR review comment. Then, let's pop a comment into #162 saying that we probably don't need it any more given this PR stack?"
   - "so, testing this build: [detailed log output] what's happened here? debug"
   - "also - I didn't see the stop hook fire?"
   - "I've still got a shadow, no condensation commit"
   - "hmm, also I just exited a _different_ session and it printed into the log for 28c304f6... [log output]"
   - "the raw claude log: [JSON transcript showing stop hook DID fire]"
   - "okay, so what have we got - there's a few things floating around yeah?"
   - "also we may have an entire reset bug as I called one a little while ago... though that may not clear out session files...add it to an investigate list"
   - "is 1 technically part of PR #170?"
   - "or #172?"
   - "write a comment in #172, I'll handle it over there"
   - "have a look at this first https://linear.app/entirehq/issue/ENT-250/... - I wrote it just a little while ago 🤦🏻‍♂️" (rejected initial comment, asked to reference ENT-250)
   - "okay, fix is pushed, let's update from parent branch alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks; there's a merge conflict"
   - "it was supposed to, yeah? 🤣" (re: deferred condensation being broken)
   - "we added that missing test in this PR yeah?"
   - "fix it up"

7. Pending Tasks (from task list):
   - **Task #1** [pending]: Fix deferred condensation — RESOLVED in parent #172, merged into this branch
   - **Task #2** [pending, blocked by #1]: Filter stale sessions in `findSessionsForWorktree` — empty-phase sessions processed on every commit
   - **Task #3** [pending, blocked by #2]: Fix log file routing — `initHookLogging()` uses `FindMostRecentSession()` which gets poisoned
   - **Task #4** [pending]: Investigate: `entire reset` may not clean up session state files in `.git/entire-sessions/`

8. Current Work:
   Fixed the integration test `TestShadow_CommitBeforeStop` which was failing after merging the TurnEnd condensation fix from parent branch #172. The test now verifies condensation happens in Phase 4 (TurnEnd from ACTIVE_COMMITTED → IDLE) rather than expecting it in a separate Phase 5 commit cycle. Test passes. The merge is uncommitted — need to run full test suite, commit, and push.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Run full test suite (`mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci`), commit the merge, and push. The user said "fix it up" referring to the failing test, which is now fixed and passing. After that, tasks #2-4 from the task list remain pending (filter stale sessions, fix log routing, investigate reset cleanup).

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/alex/.claude/projects/-Users-alex-workspace-cli--worktrees-1/1284c080-f9cd-45f8-9942-ff58f5c517e5.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

yeah let's tackle 2 and 3

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Context from previous session**: The conversation is a continuation of a previous session that ran out of context. The summary provided details about:
   - Working on PR #174 (5th PR in the ENT-221 stack) on branch `alex/ent-221-cleanup-and-sessions-fix`
   - Several bugs were discovered during manual testing
   - A task list was created with 4 items
   - Task #1 (deferred condensation) was fixed in parent branch #172
   - The integration test `TestShadow_CommitBeforeStop` was being updated

2. **First actions in this session**:
   - Checked git status (branch ahead by 2 commits, unstaged changes to integration test)
   - Ran full test suite (`mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci`) - all passed
   - Committed the integration test fix
   - User blocked push saying "we have more inbound changes coming from parent"

3. **Merge from parent branch**:
   - Fetched and merged `origin/alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks` (commit `b5e924cd`)
   - Clean merge - changes to `manual_commit_hooks.go` and new `phase_postcommit_test.go`
   - Ran full test suite - all passed
   - Marked task #1 as completed
   - Pushed successfully

4. **Tasks #2 and #3**:
   - User said "yeah let's tackle 2 and 3" referring to:
     - #2: Filter stale sessions in findSessionsForWorktree
     - #3: Fix log file routing using FindMostRecentSession
   
   - Read the plan doc, `manual_commit_hooks.go`, `manual_commit_session.go`, `hooks_git_cmd.go`, `session_state.go`
   
   **Task #2 fix** - `manual_commit_session.go`:
   - Changed cleanup condition in `listAllSessionStates()` from `state.StepCount > 0 && state.LastCheckpointID == ""` to `!state.Phase.IsActive() && state.LastCheckpointID.IsEmpty()`
   
   **Task #3 fix** - `session_state.go`:
   - Added worktree filtering to `FindMostRecentSession()`
   - Gets current worktree path, filters sessions to match
   - Falls back to all sessions if no match

   **Lint error**: `worktreePath, _ := GetWorktreePath()` - errcheck violation. Fixed by using `wpErr` variable and checking it.
   
   **Tests added**:
   - `TestShadowStrategy_ListAllSessionStates_CleansUpStaleSessions` in `manual_commit_test.go`
   - `TestFindMostRecentSession_FiltersByWorktree` in `session_state_test.go`
   - `TestFindMostRecentSession_FallsBackWhenNoWorktreeMatch` in `session_state_test.go`
   
   **Test failures**:
   - `TestFindMostRecentSession_FiltersByWorktree` failed because `t.TempDir()` on macOS returns `/var/folders/...` but `GetWorktreePath()` (which uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) resolves symlinks to `/private/var/folders/...`. Fixed by calling `GetWorktreePath()` in the test to get the resolved path.
   - Also had a typecheck error with `plumbing.Signature` which doesn't exist - simplified the test to not need a commit.

   All tests passed. Committed and pushed.

5. **User reported logs still leaking**:
   - User started a new session `6d7bc55f` but logs were going to old session `28c304f6`'s log file
   - Also stale sessions `446f6b3c`, `53a5d919`, `bc8f40a7` still appearing (likely old binary)
   - The worktree filtering doesn't help because BOTH sessions are in the same worktree
   - The core issue: `initHookLogging()` runs in `PersistentPreRunE` BEFORE the handler parses stdin, so it uses `FindMostRecentSession()` which returns the old session

6. **Current work - fixing agent hook log routing**:
   - Identified the fix: after agent hook handlers parse stdin and know the actual session ID, reinitialize logging to the correct log file
   - `logging.Init()` already handles close-and-reopen
   - Started editing `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` - added `logging.Init(sessionID)` in `parseAndLogHookInput()` (covers user-prompt-submit)
   - Still need to add the same to: `handleSessionStartCommon()`, `handleClaudeCodeSessionEnd()`, `commitWithMetadata()`
   - Was interrupted by the summary request

Let me enumerate all user messages and verify all details are captured.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Continue work from a previous session on PR #174 (branch `alex/ent-221-cleanup-and-sessions-fix`), the 5th PR in the ENT-221 stack
   - Merge incoming changes from parent branch `alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks`
   - Tackle tasks #2 (filter stale sessions in `findSessionsForWorktree`) and #3 (fix log file routing using `FindMostRecentSession`)
   - After initial fixes for tasks #2/#3, user reported logs still leaking across sessions, revealing that the worktree-scoping fix was insufficient — the real problem is that `initHookLogging()` runs before agent hooks parse stdin

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Session Phase State Machine**: Phases (ACTIVE, ACTIVE_COMMITTED, IDLE, ENDED) with events and actions
   - **Shadow branches**: `entire/<commit-hash[:7]>-<worktreeHash[:6]>` for temporary checkpoint storage
   - **`initHookLogging()`**: Runs in `PersistentPreRunE` (before `RunE`), calls `FindMostRecentSession()` to route logs — but for agent hooks, the actual session ID comes from stdin parsed in `RunE`
   - **`logging.Init(sessionID)`**: Closes previous log file, opens new one at `.entire/logs/<session-id>.log`, sets `currentSessionID` for all subsequent log lines. Can be called multiple times (handles close-and-reopen).
   - **Stale sessions**: Pre-state-machine sessions with empty phase that were never cleaned up, getting processed every PostCommit and bumping `LastInteractionTime`
   - **`listAllSessionStates()` cleanup**: When shadow branch doesn't exist, clean up non-active sessions without LastCheckpointID
   - **Agent hook architecture**: `PersistentPreRunE` → `initHookLogging()` → `RunE` → handler parses stdin → gets session ID. Log routing is set before session ID is known.

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_session.go`** (lines 82-100)
     - Contains `listAllSessionStates()` which filters orphaned sessions
     - Changed cleanup condition to catch all stale non-active sessions
     ```go
     // Old condition:
     if state.StepCount > 0 && state.LastCheckpointID == "" {
     // New condition:
     if !state.Phase.IsActive() && state.LastCheckpointID.IsEmpty() {
     ```
     - Full replacement block:
     ```go
     if _, err := repo.Reference(refName, true); err != nil {
         if !state.Phase.IsActive() && state.LastCheckpointID.IsEmpty() {
             //nolint:errcheck,gosec // G104: Cleanup is best-effort, shouldn't fail the list operation
             store.Clear(context.Background(), state.SessionID)
             continue
         }
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/session_state.go`** (lines 120-162)
     - Contains `FindMostRecentSession()` — added worktree filtering
     - Full updated function:
     ```go
     func FindMostRecentSession() string {
         states, err := ListSessionStates()
         if err != nil || len(states) == 0 {
             return ""
         }
         // Scope to current worktree to prevent cross-worktree pollution.
         worktreePath, wpErr := GetWorktreePath()
         if wpErr == nil && worktreePath != "" {
             var filtered []*SessionState
             for _, s := range states {
                 if s.WorktreePath == worktreePath {
                     filtered = append(filtered, s)
                 }
             }
             if len(filtered) > 0 {
                 states = filtered
             }
             // If no sessions match the worktree, fall back to all sessions
         }
         var best *SessionState
         for _, s := range states {
             if s.LastInteractionTime == nil {
                 continue
             }
             if best == nil || s.LastInteractionTime.After(*best.LastInteractionTime) {
                 best = s
             }
         }
         if best != nil {
             return best.SessionID
         }
         // Fallback: return most recently started session
         for _, s := range states {
             if best == nil || s.StartedAt.After(best.StartedAt) {
                 best = s
             }
         }
         if best != nil {
             return best.SessionID
         }
         return ""
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_test.go`**
     - Added `TestShadowStrategy_ListAllSessionStates_CleansUpStaleSessions` — verifies that stale sessions (empty phase, IDLE, ENDED without LastCheckpointID) are cleaned up, while active sessions and sessions with LastCheckpointID are preserved

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/session_state_test.go`**
     - Added `TestFindMostRecentSession_FiltersByWorktree` — verifies worktree filtering returns current worktree's session even if another worktree's session is more recent
     - Added `TestFindMostRecentSession_FallsBackWhenNoWorktreeMatch` — verifies fallback to all sessions when none match current worktree

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/phase_transitions_test.go`**
     - Updated `TestShadow_CommitBeforeStop` for TurnEnd condensation behavior (from earlier merge fix)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go`**
     - Contains all Claude Code hook handlers
     - Key handlers: `parseAndLogHookInput()` (user-prompt-submit), `commitWithMetadata()` (stop), `handleClaudeCodeSessionEnd()`, and `handleClaudeCodeSessionStart()` → `handleSessionStartCommon()` in hooks.go
     - **PARTIAL EDIT IN PROGRESS**: Added `logging.Init(sessionID)` in `parseAndLogHookInput()` after getting the session ID from stdin:
     ```go
     sessionID := input.SessionID
     if sessionID == "" {
         sessionID = unknownSessionID
     }

     // Redirect logging to the actual session's log file (initHookLogging
     // guessed the session before stdin was parsed, which may be wrong).
     if err := logging.Init(sessionID); err != nil {
         fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Warning: failed to redirect logging: %v\n", err)
     }

     logCtx := logging.WithAgent(logging.WithComponent(context.Background(), "hooks"), ag.Name())
     logging.Info(logCtx, "user-prompt-submit",
     ```
     - **Still needs**: Same fix in `commitWithMetadata()`, `handleClaudeCodeSessionEnd()`, and `handleSessionStartCommon()` (in hooks.go)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hook_registry.go`**
     - Contains `newAgentHooksCmd()` with `PersistentPreRunE` that calls `initHookLogging()` for agent hooks
     - Contains `newAgentHookVerbCmdWithLogging()` which creates commands for specific hooks

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_git_cmd.go`**
     - Contains `initHookLogging()` which calls `FindMostRecentSession()` and `logging.Init()`
     - Contains git hook commands (prepare-commit-msg, post-commit, etc.)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/logging/logger.go`**
     - `logging.Init(sessionID)` closes previous log file, opens new one, sets `currentSessionID`
     - `currentSessionID` is prepended to ALL log lines via `getSessionID()`
     - Safe to call multiple times (handles close-and-reopen)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks.go`**
     - Contains `handleSessionStartCommon()` which parses stdin at line 248, gets `input.SessionID`
     - Needs `logging.Init(input.SessionID)` added after parsing

   - **`docs/plans/2026-02-06-session-phase-state-machine-v2.md`**
     - Read for context on the session phase state machine design (opened by user in IDE)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_hooks.go`**
     - Read for context on PostCommit processing, PrepareCommitMsg, InitializeSession, HandleTurnEnd

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **errcheck lint violation**: `worktreePath, _ := GetWorktreePath()` in `FindMostRecentSession()`. Fixed by using named error variable: `worktreePath, wpErr := GetWorktreePath()` and checking `wpErr == nil`.
   - **`plumbing.Signature` undefined**: Test tried to create a commit using `plumbing.Signature` which doesn't exist (it's in `plumbing/object`). Simplified the test to not need a commit — just `git.PlainInit` is sufficient for `GetWorktreePath()`.
   - **macOS symlink path mismatch**: `TestFindMostRecentSession_FiltersByWorktree` failed because `t.TempDir()` returns `/var/folders/...` but `GetWorktreePath()` resolves symlinks to `/private/var/folders/...`. Fixed by calling `GetWorktreePath()` in the test to get the resolved path and using it as the session's WorktreePath.
   - **Worktree filtering insufficient for same-worktree sessions**: User reported logs still leaking between sessions in the same worktree. The root cause is `initHookLogging()` runs in `PersistentPreRunE` before stdin is parsed. Fix: reinitialize logging after parsing stdin in each agent hook handler.

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Stale session cleanup** (solved): Pre-state-machine sessions with empty phase survived cleanup because the old condition only cleaned up sessions with `StepCount > 0`. Broadened to clean up all non-active sessions without LastCheckpointID when shadow branch is gone.
   - **Cross-worktree log pollution** (solved): `FindMostRecentSession()` now filters by current worktree.
   - **Same-worktree log routing** (IN PROGRESS): Agent hooks parse stdin in `RunE` but logging initializes in `PersistentPreRunE`. Solution is to call `logging.Init(sessionID)` after each handler parses stdin. Started implementing — edited `parseAndLogHookInput()` but still need to add to 3 other handlers.
   - **Stale sessions still appearing in PostCommit** (likely old binary): User's build was compiled before the stale session cleanup fix. Needs rebuild.

6. All User Messages:
   - "yeah let's tackle 2 and 3"
   - "we have more inbound changes coming from parent alex/ent-221-phase-aware-git-hooks" (blocked push)
   - "so I started a new session .entire/logs/6d7bc55f-f28f-40e9-bf76-867c7cde3fdd.log but the logs are still leaking into [log output for 28c304f6] and this is the log for the new session: [log output for 6d7bc55f]" — reported that the worktree fix was insufficient, logs from new session `6d7bc55f` go to old session `28c304f6`'s log file

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task #3 (reopened)**: Fix agent hook log routing — need to add `logging.Init(sessionID)` after stdin parsing in: `handleSessionStartCommon()` (hooks.go), `handleClaudeCodeSessionEnd()` (hooks_claudecode_handlers.go), `commitWithMetadata()` (hooks_claudecode_handlers.go). Already done for `parseAndLogHookInput()`.
   - **Task #4**: Investigate: `entire reset` may not clean up session state files in `.git/entire-sessions/`
   - Need to run fmt/lint/test after completing the logging reinit changes
   - Need to commit and push

8. Current Work:
   Fixing agent hook log routing. The user reported that logs from new session `6d7bc55f` are being written to old session `28c304f6`'s log file because `initHookLogging()` in `PersistentPreRunE` uses `FindMostRecentSession()` which returns the old session before the new session's stdin is parsed.
   
   I have already edited `parseAndLogHookInput()` in `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` to add `logging.Init(sessionID)` after parsing stdin (covers the user-prompt-submit hook). The edit moved the `sessionID` assignment before the logging call and added:
   ```go
   // Redirect logging to the actual session's log file (initHookLogging
   // guessed the session before stdin was parsed, which may be wrong).
   if err := logging.Init(sessionID); err != nil {
       fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Warning: failed to redirect logging: %v\n", err)
   }
   ```
   
   Still need to add the same pattern to these three handlers:
   1. `commitWithMetadata()` in `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` — after line 117 where `sessionID` is set
   2. `handleClaudeCodeSessionEnd()` in `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` — after line 715 where `input.SessionID` is parsed
   3. `handleSessionStartCommon()` in `hooks.go` — after line 248 where `input.SessionID` is parsed

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the logging reinit fix by adding `logging.Init(sessionID)` to the remaining 3 handlers (`commitWithMetadata`, `handleClaudeCodeSessionEnd`, `handleSessionStartCommon`), then run `mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci`, commit, and push. This directly continues the work started in response to the user's report: "so I started a new session .entire/logs/6d7bc55f-f28f-40e9-bf76-867c7cde3fdd.log but the logs are still leaking into..."

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/alex/.claude/projects/-Users-alex-workspace-cli--worktrees-1/1284c080-f9cd-45f8-9942-ff58f5c517e5.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

---

I think let's have one per worktree, the session id fields in each line give us a filter condition

---

nah let's roll back, they don't really need to exist in the future state

---

okay, so I've got that test repo open, what do I need to test manually? (and what state should I go from?)

---

1. the sessions file doesn't appear until the first prompt (by design I think)
2. I note the state change in the file from active -> idle 
Logs don't seem to show the state transitions anymore though?
