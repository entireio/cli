How about this logic: 

- if there is no folder for the current checkpoint, create one, do as today but add a `session_count` field and initialize it with 1, add `sessions_ids` and initialize it as an array with the current session_id
- if there is a folder, read "session_count", create a folder with that number (so first will be 1) and then move the existing files (copy not move current metadata.json)  there, put the new files in the normal place, update metadata.json so `session_id` points to the new one, `session_ids` gets the new one added, `session_count` will be increased by 1, "files_touched" will be merged, checkpoints_count also increased.

One question: The way we commit into the `entire/sessions` branch, would we handle this correctly?

---

but if - while this is running - another commit would be made to the same folder, what happens then?

---

I was less worried about this happening from a single entire cli execution, but more if two different git commits happen, but then it would fail anyhow since the second commit (on the real branch) would fail on a git level already, right?

---

yes

this looks a bit strange: ❯ Operation stopped by hook: Another session is active: "---

  How about this logic:

  - if there is no ..."

  You can continue here, but checkpoints from both sessions will be interleaved.

  To resume the other session instead, close here and run: claude -r 44df7d08-6bc4-4532-bef8-167ea3797cee

Can we add "You can press the up arrow key to get the prompt you just typed again"

---

can you proof read this?

---

", exit claude and run"

---

can you print a full example again?
