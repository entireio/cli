The pathSafeRegex is also duplicated from paths package and should be removed along with the validation functions. The validation package is now the single source of truth for this regex pattern.

The validation package is critical for security (preventing path traversal attacks) and is used throughout the codebase, but it lacks unit tests. Consider adding unit tests to verify the validation behavior, especially edge cases like empty strings, path separators, special characters, and valid formats. The stringutil and textutil packages in this codebase demonstrate the convention of comprehensive test coverage for utility packages.

can you review the added tests that they don't duplicate testing, don't test standard libraries and are usefu

The ModelSessionID function has parsing logic that extracts the agent UUID from an Entire session ID, but it lacks direct unit tests. Consider adding tests that verify correct extraction of the UUID from valid formats (e.g., "2026-01-23-uuid-here"), handling of invalid formats (returns as-is for backwards compatibility), and edge cases like empty strings or malformed dates.
