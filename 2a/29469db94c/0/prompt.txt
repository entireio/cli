when running: 
❯ entire enable

✓ Enabled (manual-commit)

I'd like us to show more what else is setup. Like for each step there should be a check mark listed. Can you take a look and propose change?

---

Instead of "Strategy initialized" we should do "<strategy name> strategy initialized" and remove "(manual-commit)" from "Enabled"

---

now when I rerun `entire enable` and there is already a `.entire/settings.json` we default to updating `.entire/settings.local.json`. I'd like to change this so it's more interactive. If there is a settings.json already we ask if it should be updated, or if local settings should be used instead.

---

going back to the changes before: when I rerun `entire enable` it says again "✓ Claude Code hooks installed" and
"✓ .entire directory created" is there a way to improve this, especially the second and only say it when it actually happened?

---

could we also do "Git hooks verified" ?

---

can you add some tests for the new functionality?
