if my api key is "REDACTED" give me the build command to have a binary ready to send events

---

the command string send to posthog only contains the last command of cobra. if "entire session list" is sending "list" it should send "entire session list"

---

i do also want to send the command flags and arguments, in other words, the whole thing executed by the user

---

give me a build command that sets also the cli version

---

add a test that checks we are sending the full command
