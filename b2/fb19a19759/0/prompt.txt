can you do some research for me for good open source repository bug templates? and propose a template we could use for the entire cli that tracks for example important information for us? (os, os version, agent, strategy, entire version)

---

do they have unique templates for feature requests? or can we make it one?

---

ok, lets

[Request interrupted by user]

---

ok let's create your proposed bug form, and then do the same research for feature requests across the repos and propose a yml for that too

---

yes

---

what other templates does these repos you looked at so far have?

---

can we add a free field for the terminal used to the form?

---

yeah bug report only

---

can you make the agent a free form field and just give "Claude Code, Gemini" as example

---

how can I test these forms while still in a branch on GitHub?
