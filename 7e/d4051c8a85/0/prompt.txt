what I'm trying to achieve there is, something like stripe-cli is doing about handling errors. 
Which in our case would be like:
1. if error is type of cli.SilentError, do not print anything. The command has already printed the error
2. if there is error, always exit with os.Exit(1)
3. if error message contains "unknown command" call showSuggestion()
4. default just print the error

Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Fix Error Handling in main.go

## Goal
Implement stripe-cli style error handling with this priority:

1. **SilentError** → Don't print anything (command already printed)
2. **"unknown command"** → Call `showSuggestion()` instead of raw error
3. **Default** → Print the error
4. **Always** → Exit with `os.Exit(1)` on any error

## Current Issue
Line 31 has `errors.Is(err, *cli.SilentError)` which is invalid - `*cli.SilentError` is a type, not a value. The code should only use `errors.As()`.

## Implementation

**File:** `cmd/entire/main.go`

Replace the error handling block (lines 30-39) with:

```go
if err != nil {
    var silent *cli.SilentError

    switch {
    case errors.As(err, &silent):
        // Command already printed the error
    case strings.Contains(err.Error(), "unknown command"):
        showSuggestion()
    default:
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
    }

    cancel()
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

**Additional change:** Add `"strings"` to imports.

## Files to Modify
- `cmd/entire/main.go` - Fix error handling logic and add strings import

## Verification
1. Run `mise run fmt && mise run lint` - should pass
2. Run `mise run test` - existing tests should pass
3. Manual test: Run `entire unknowncommand` - should show suggestion
4. Manual test: A command that returns SilentError - should not double-print

fix this: cannot use err (variable of interface type error) as string value in argument to fmt.Fprintf
