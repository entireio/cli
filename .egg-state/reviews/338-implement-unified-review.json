  "summary": "PID-based session matching for concurrent checkpoint condensation is well-implemented. All 7 plan tasks are addressed across 3 new source files and 4 modified files. The fix correctly solves the root cause described in issue #338: PrepareCommitMsg now deterministically identifies the committing session via PPID chain walking instead of relying on nondeterministic os.ReadDir order. Backward compatibility is preserved via AgentPID=0 fallback to LastInteractionTime sorting. 37 new tests cover core PID matching, platform-specific PPID lookup, session persistence, integration scenarios, and edge cases. Documentation is thorough with cross-references across 3 architecture docs.",
