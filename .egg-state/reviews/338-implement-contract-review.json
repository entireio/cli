  "summary": "All 8 contract tasks across 3 phases are fully implemented. Core PID infrastructure (AgentPID field, PPID chain walker, LastInteractionTime sort) is correct. PrepareCommitMsg integration uses PID matching first with time-based fallback. Unit tests cover match/no-match/zero-PID/sort-ordering scenarios. Integration tests verify concurrent session selection for both PID-match and fallback paths. FindMostRecentSession tested for deterministic selection. Documentation accurately describes the concurrent session handling flow with cross-references in related architecture docs.",
