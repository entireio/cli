Update the @docs/architecture/wingman.md with the latest changes that have been made. E.g. the Configuartion isn't complete.

The Session-end hook (triggerWingmanAutoApplyOnSessionEnd) never actually worked, but I also think it's a weird scenario, so let's just remove that entirely. If the session is closed and there's a REVIEW.md it either gets picked up by another main session or it goes stale and will be removed. What do you think?
