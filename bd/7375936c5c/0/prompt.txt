what is the output if you run "entire status" ?

---

I do want this command to behave like:
entire status
  Enable (manual-commit)

and
entire status --long
  Project, enabled (manual-commit)                                                                                                                                                                     
  Local, disabled (auto-commit)

What is the difference between LoadEntireSettings and loadSettingsFromFile

test are failing at github actions, not if I run the test locally. This is the error:

evaluate this feedback from copilot:
"""
The new loadSettingsFromFile function lacks the empty strategy fallback that LoadEntireSettings has. When a settings file contains "strategy": "" (a valid scenario tested in TestLoadEntireSettings_EmptyStrategyInLocalDoesNotOverride), the --long status output displays "Local, enabled ()" with empty parentheses, which is confusing. LoadEntireSettings applies a default when strategy is empty, but loadSettingsFromFile returns the empty string as-is.

reduce duplicated code around those methods LoadEntireSettings and loadSettingsFromFile, they seem to do almost the same but totally different implementations
