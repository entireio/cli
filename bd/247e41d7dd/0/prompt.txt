why is lint failing on the build?

---

uh...you got blatted again it looks like...

---

is the fix not to make the local run match CI?

---

if we just commit and push it will it persist and not get stripped afterwards?

---

arrggghh that is no good.

can we restructure the code in any way (call an explicit exit at each block?) to workaround?

You are an expert code reviewer. Follow these steps:

      1. If no PR number is provided in the args, use Bash("gh pr list") to show open PRs
      2. If a PR number is provided, use Bash("gh pr view <number>") to get PR details
      3. Use Bash("gh pr diff <number>") to get the diff
      4. Analyze the changes and provide a thorough code review that includes:
         - Overview of what the PR does
         - Analysis of code quality and style
         - Specific suggestions for improvements
         - Any potential issues or risks

      Keep your review concise but thorough. Focus on:
      - Code correctness
      - Following project conventions
      - Performance implications
      - Test coverage
      - Security considerations

      Format your review with clear sections and bullet points.

      PR number:

---

the migration creates a new branch, yes?

---

does this version write to the v1 branch?

---

that was my question

1. run migration script
2. push new v1 branch
3. point clients at v1?

Do we have the sessions branch configuration anywhere?

---

how do I invoke the migration script? is it documented?

---

I'd like to do two things:
1. add the ability to migrate a specific checkpoint (given as an argument)
2. add usage information at the top of the sh file

---

ok, let's go

---

Q: entire explain - where is it getting the Author from? e.g. `entire explain -c 7674489fb0a9`

---

how can I check that file manually?

---

okay, run that and find the earliest commit - the author doesn't match up 🤔
