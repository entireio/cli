Right now we have a pre-push hook that would ask you if you want to push the `entire/sessions` branch. We think it's a better idea to default to "yes" in this case and only allow an option for enable / disable to skip it. Can you suggest how to implement this?

Yes, do B

I'd like to add an option `--skip-push-sessions` to enable (would instead of "on" set it to off).

newSetupAgentHooksCmd() <- I wonder why we even still have that command

---

yes
