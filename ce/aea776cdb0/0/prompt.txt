commit this, then let's do the other bit

---

do you mean changing the interface of `PromptOverwriteNewerLogs`?

---

ugh. is there anyway we can sub out the tty underneath the huh library instead?

---

that's bringing in a new dependency?

---

okay, let's try the pty approach (creack/pty is MIT so should be ok👌🏽)

---

read/write would be awesome. though we can still centrally manage the timeout concerns?
