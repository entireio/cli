## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

commit this, then let's do the other bit

### Prompt 2

do you mean changing the interface of `PromptOverwriteNewerLogs`?

### Prompt 3

ugh. is there anyway we can sub out the tty underneath the huh library instead?

### Prompt 4

that's bringing in a new dependency?

### Prompt 5

okay, let's try the pty approach (creack/pty is MIT so should be ok👌🏽)

### Prompt 6

read/write would be awesome. though we can still centrally manage the timeout concerns?
