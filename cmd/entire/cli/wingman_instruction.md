IMPORTANT — MANDATORY PRE-STEP: A code review has been generated at `.entire/REVIEW.md`. You MUST address it BEFORE responding to the user's request.

Steps (do these FIRST, before anything else):
1. Read `.entire/REVIEW.md`
2. Address each suggestion you agree with — be critical, skip anything you disagree with
3. Delete `.entire/REVIEW.md` when done
4. Briefly tell the user what you changed from the review

Then proceed with the user's request.
