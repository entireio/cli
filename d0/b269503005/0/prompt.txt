Implement the following plan:

# Fix `entire explain` branch filtering with merge commits

## Context

`entire explain` branch filtering breaks when a feature branch has merge commits from main. The root cause: `repo.Log()` with `git.LogOrderCommitterTime` traverses ALL parents of merge commits (full DAG walk). After merging main into a feature branch, the walker enters main's full history. The `consecutiveMainLimit` (100) fires before older feature branch checkpoints are found, silently dropping them.

go-git v5's `LogOptions` has no `FirstParent` option, so we need manual first-parent traversal.

## Changes

### 1. Extract first-parent walk helper in `explain.go`

Create a `walkFirstParentCommits` helper that walks the first-parent chain from a starting hash, calling a visitor function for each commit. Stops at `commitScanLimit`.

```go
func walkFirstParentCommits(repo *git.Repository, from plumbing.Hash, limit int, fn func(*object.Commit) error) error
```

This replaces both `repo.Log()` call sites that walk the user's branch.

### 2. Simplify `getBranchCheckpoints()` (~explain.go:803)

**Remove:**
- `isOnDefault` / `mainBranchHash` / default branch resolution block (lines 830-849) — only needed for `reachableFromMain` filtering, which is no longer necessary
- `reachableFromMain` precomputation (lines 852-868)
- `consecutiveMainLimit` constant and `consecutiveMainCount` tracking (lines 883, 893-902)

**Replace:** `repo.Log()` at line 872 with `walkFirstParentCommits`. The visitor function only needs to extract checkpoint trailers and look up committed checkpoints — no main-branch skip logic needed.

**Keep:** `isOnDefault` is still needed for `getReachableTemporaryCheckpoints()` call at line 952. Compute it separately just for that.

### 3. Simplify `getAssociatedCommits()` (~explain.go:455)

**Remove:**
- `isOnDefault` / `mainBranchHash` block (lines 468-471)
- `reachableFromMain` precomputation (lines 474-490)
- The `reachableFromMain` skip check (line 512)

**Replace:** `repo.Log()` at line 492 with `walkFirstParentCommits`.

### 4. Update `isShadowBranchReachable()` (~explain.go:998)

**Replace:** `repo.Log()` at line 1005 with first-parent traversal for consistency. Shadow branch base commits should be on the first-parent chain if the session was started on this branch.

### 5. Clean up dead code

- Remove `consecutiveMainLimit` constant (line 791) if no longer referenced
- Remove `strategy.GetMainBranchHash()` import if unused after changes
- Remove `strategy.GetDefaultBranchName()` usage from `getBranchCheckpoints` if no longer needed there

### 6. Add regression test

Add `TestGetBranchCheckpoints_WithMergeFromMain` to `explain_test.go`:
- Create repo with main branch and several commits
- Create feature branch with a checkpoint commit
- Merge main into feature (creating a merge commit at HEAD)
- Add another feature checkpoint commit after the merge
- Call `getBranchCheckpoints()` — verify BOTH feature checkpoint commits appear
- This is the exact scenario that was broken

Also add `TestGetBranchCheckpoints_MergeCommitAtHEAD` to verify the case where HEAD itself is the merge commit.

## Files to modify

- `cmd/entire/cli/explain.go` — main changes (3 call sites + new helper + remove constants)
- `cmd/entire/cli/explain_test.go` — add regression tests

## Files NOT modified

- `checkpoint/temporary.go` `ListCheckpointsForBranch()` — walks shadow branches which are linear (no merges)
- `checkpoint/committed.go` `GetCheckpointAuthor()` — walks `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch; merge handling there is a separate concern

## Verification

```bash
mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci
```

Specifically verify:
- New test `TestGetBranchCheckpoints_WithMergeFromMain` passes
- New test `TestGetBranchCheckpoints_MergeCommitAtHEAD` passes
- Existing tests `TestGetBranchCheckpoints_FiltersMainCommits` and `TestGetBranchCheckpoints_OnFeatureBranch` still pass
- Integration tests pass: `mise run test:integration`

commit this

---

okay, so pop quiz - what should this version of entire explain show us for this branch?

---

well, I've just reset our branch to origin/main then cherry-picked our commit...

also it does have a checkpoint id -> Entire-Checkpoint: d0b269503005

do a git log/show to have a look around.

so _I_ would have expected a single checkpoint...

---

whoops! yeah let's put the reachableFromMain back...

---

okay...now for these temporary ones....

can we tell if they're relevant to this workspace?
