can you look at the changes in this branch and let me know what effort it is to fix this: 

The humanModified calculation at line 235 uses min(totalUserAdded, totalUserRemoved) to estimate modifications, but this doesn't distinguish between user modifications to agent code vs. user modifications to their own code. When a user modifies their own previously-added lines (e.g., removes 3 of their accumulated lines and adds 3 different ones), the formula at line 256 (agentLinesInCommit := max(0, totalAgentAdded-pureUserRemoved-humanModified)) incorrectly subtracts these self-modifications from the agent's line count. This causes agent contributions to be undercounted when users edit their own code between or after checkpoints.

how would you track line ownership?

---

how do line hashes work if you have the same line in the file multiple time, like for example `  }` will be there multiple times

---

could we create a summary of the options for this and what we went with (I'd go with option 4 now as a simple improvement) but keep it in the repo. So could we do a ADR doc in docs/architecture too

---

Lets do the implementation too

---

can we rewrite the ADR so it's more like how the whole line attribution feature works now? Like not starting from current bug but write it in the context of the PR/Branch which adds the whole feature. Also don't give it a number and it needs no date or status in the file

---

The CalculatedAt timestamp uses time.Now() which includes the local timezone. For consistency with other timestamps in the codebase that serialize to JSON (like incremental checkpoints), consider using time.Now().UTC() instead. While this is consistent with the existing CreatedAt field in CommittedMetadata (line 329), using UTC would be more consistent with incremental checkpoint timestamps and avoid timezone-related issues when comparing timestamps across systems.

Can we do this, but can you first check if we really use UTC consistently?

Missing UserAddedPerFile field causes lost per-file tracking

Medium Severity

The session.PromptAttribution struct is missing the UserAddedPerFile field that exists in strategy.PromptAttribution. When session state is saved via sessionStateFromStrategy, the UserAddedPerFile map is lost because the destination type lacks this field. This causes estimateUserSelfModifications to always return 0, incorrectly attributing user self-modifications as agent modifications, resulting in under-counted agent lines and inflated agent modification counts.

---

Duplicated comment line in attribution function

Low Severity

Lines 366 and 367 contain an identical duplicated comment: "Track per-file user additions for accurate modification tracking". One of these duplicate lines appears to be accidentally repeated.

---

Low Severity

When reading files from the worktree in calculatePromptAttributionAtStart, binary files are not filtered (lines 1016-1017 use os.ReadFile without null-byte checking). However, getFileContent used for tree content returns empty string for binary files (null-byte check at line 90). This inconsistency causes diffLines(referenceContent, worktreeContent) to compare empty string against raw binary data, producing garbage line counts that inflate UserLinesAdded when binary files are changed.

---

question: doesn't git know if it's a binary file?
