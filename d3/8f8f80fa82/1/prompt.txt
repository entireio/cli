can you review the e2e integration tests in cmd/entire/cli/e2e_test if they are testing the right things and are in line with other documentation in the repo?

2. Strengthen auto-commit tests - Add ValidateCheckpoint calls

3. Make logs-only rewind test deterministic - Assert specific expected behavior
