thinking about "Refactored findCommitMessageByCheckpointID() to search the branch hint first" if I worked on the branch locally, created a PR and then merged it. I would not care about the branch anymore but more that the commit/session is merged into the default branch. So wondering if we should rather fallback to the branch. And then session list could also show that a session belongs to a merged commit?
