Can you review the changes in this branch, especially around existing sessions after this would be applied. Like what happens if I resume an old session with the old format, or have an active session and with the old format and now update and a hook fires, will it figure out how to handle this? And on top of that: I think even more code can be removed now if we don't mess with the raw session ids anymore.

---

let's do Add migration logic in handleSessionStart() to check for existing old-format sessions

---

why is one method having the agent in the name the other not?

---

I also meant:   - handleSessionStart() in hooks_claudecode_handlers.go
  - handleGeminiSessionStart() in hooks_geminicli_handlers.go

---

yeah I feel the prefix is redundant

---

ok, if that's the case we need to make "handleSessionStart" -> "handleClaudeCodeSessionStart"

---

can you commit both changes we did in individual commits for me?
