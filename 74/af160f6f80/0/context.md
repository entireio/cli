# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

can you generate me a summary for the PR with the output when running `entire enable` before and after the changes in this branch?

### Prompt 2

we should update "Created orphan branch 'entire/sessions' for session metadata" to also have a check mark in front

### Prompt 3

when does this happen with the manual commit strategy? it also uses that branch, right but we currently have no message about it there?

### Prompt 4

yes

### Prompt 5

can you again summarize the before / after messaging for the PR body?

### Prompt 6

why are the errors changed to return "" in /cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/testenv.go

### Prompt 7

but all the context of why there was no checkpoint id is lost now, right?
