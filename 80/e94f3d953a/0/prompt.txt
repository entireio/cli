Can you read docs/architecture/shadow-branch-suffixes.md, I'd like to modify this approach: I don't think we need suffixes but instead we just use one branch, is there overlap in files we continue, if there is no overlap and the new session did create local changes, then we reset the shadow branch to a clean state. Can you ultrathink about it and come up with a new plan?

---

the issue with the old solution is that there is also no way out of the edge case (5) since yes, we have the old branch, but figuring out that the user reset and then stash apply the old changes is not trivial either and wasn't part of the initial plan, we could build that later (and then use suffixed branches) but for now I think that just adds complexity

---

yes, but I think we should start relatively fresh from main branch, can you switch, write a new architecture document replacing the multi one

---

[Request interrupted by user]

---

continue, network should be better now

---

one follow up: in case of "stash" -> new session, reset shadow branch when file changes happen -> can we reliable figure out when those file changes happen? Or would we rather track at the beginning of the new session that there is no overlap and by that keep a flag on the property that anything that would cause a checkpoint on the shadow branch will reset it?

---

If the second sessions would create files that do overlap (which is not unlikely) then we still should not continue. There is of course the issue that you do one prompt (no file changes yet, file system has still changes from prior session) and then decide "ok, this is better" and then reset the file directory. So I think at the beginning of a prompt we should do the comparision (are there still changes that belong to the prior session?) and keep that as a state. If there would be a call to SaveChanges during that prompt, then the flag decides what to do, if there isn't the flag is reset and we do another check at the next promp start. Does that make sense?

---

yes, update the architecture document first

---

can we add that we also invert the existing disable-multisession-warning and keep a functionality as today that you can enable and would always warn at the beginnig of a second session (and rerunning the prompt would mean merge the sessions)

---

Yes, but I'd like to do a TDD approach with integration tests, let's first setup integration tests for the scenarios and then we do the implementation.

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

Can we not commit the doc/testing docs? I think the `docs/requirement` folder is already gitignored so we could move it there while the work is ongoing?

---

1+2

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked me to read `docs/architecture/shadow-branch-suffixes.md` and proposed a simplified approach: use one branch instead of suffixes, with overlap detection to determine whether to continue or reset the shadow branch.

2. **Architecture Review**: I read the document which described a complex suffix-based approach to handle interleaved sessions. The user's insight was that this complexity wasn't solving the edge cases anyway, so we should simplify.

3. **New Architecture Document**: I created `docs/architecture/shadow-branch-overlap.md` describing:
   - Single branch approach with file overlap detection
   - Three-phase logic: check at prompt start, use flag at checkpoint time, clear at prompt end
   - Multi-session warning feature (opt-in)

4. **User Feedback on Documentation**: User asked to NOT commit testing docs but move them to `docs/requirements/` (gitignored). I moved the test documentation there.

5. **TDD Approach**: User requested TDD approach with integration tests first, then implementation. I created two test files:
   - `shadow_branch_overlap_test.go` - 6 tests for core scenarios
   - `multi_session_warning_test.go` - 4 tests for warning feature

6. **Test Setup Issues**: Initial tests had setup problems (files needed to exist in base commit for `git restore` to work). I fixed these by adding commits before tests.

7. **Running Tests**: User asked for "1+2" (run tests + start implementation). Tests failed as expected, showing the real bug (ghost files in shadow branch).

8. **Implementation Started**: I created task list and implemented:
   - Task 1: Added `ShouldResetShadowBranch` field to `SessionState`
   - Task 2: Implemented `getFilesTouchedByShadow()` and `fileSetIntersection()` helpers
   - Task 3: Implemented `OnPromptStart()` hook to check overlap
   - Task 4: Modified `SaveChanges()` to reset shadow branch when flag is set
   - Task 5: Implemented `OnPromptEnd()` to clear flag

9. **Current Task**: Task 6 - Wire up hooks to CLI. I was finding where to register the new hooks in the hook registry when the summary was requested.

Key technical details:
- The overlap detection happens at **prompt start** (before any file modifications) to correctly detect stash scenarios
- Shadow branch reset involves deleting the branch and resetting checkpoint count
- Manual commit strategy only (auto-commit doesn't use shadow branches)
- Tests use `TestEnv` infrastructure with isolated git repos

Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
   - User wanted to replace the complex suffix-based shadow branch approach with a simpler single-branch approach using file overlap detection
   - The key insight: suffixes don't solve edge cases (stash + new work on different files) anyway, so simplify now and add complexity later if needed
   - Approach: Check worktree/shadow overlap at prompt start, set flag, use flag at checkpoint time to decide whether to reset
   - Also add opt-in multi-session warning feature
   - Follow TDD: write integration tests first, then implement

2. **Key Technical Concepts**:
   - Shadow branches: temporary branches (entire/<hash>) storing checkpoint data
   - Ghost files bug: dismissed files remain in shadow tree when sessions interleave
   - File overlap detection: comparing files in shadow branch vs worktree to determine continuation
   - Three-phase detection: prompt start (set flag), checkpoint time (use flag), prompt end (clear flag)
   - Manual commit strategy: stores checkpoints on shadow branches, condenses on git commit
   - Session state: persisted in `.git/entire-sessions/<session-id>.json`
   - TDD approach: tests before implementation

3. **Files and Code Sections**:

   - **`docs/architecture/shadow-branch-overlap.md`** (Created)
     - Complete architecture document for single-branch overlap detection
     - Documents 6 scenarios with expected behavior
     - Includes multi-session warning design
     - Key decision: check overlap at prompt start to correctly handle stash scenarios
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/shadow_branch_overlap_test.go`** (Created)
     - 6 integration tests covering all scenarios:
       - `TestShadowBranchOverlap_ContinueWork` - file overlap, continue on same branch
       - `TestShadowBranchOverlap_DismissAndStartFresh` - no overlap, reset branch
       - `TestShadowBranchOverlap_PartialDismiss` - some overlap, continue
       - `TestShadowBranchOverlap_StashAnswerQuestionsUnstash` - preserve checkpoint data
       - `TestShadowBranchOverlap_StashNewWorkSameFiles` - demonstrates prompt-start check importance
       - `TestShadowBranchOverlap_StashNewWorkDifferentFiles` - accepted limitation
     - Fixed setup issues: added base commits before tests so `git restore` works
     - Currently failing with ghost files bug (expected)
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/multi_session_warning_test.go`** (Created)
     - 4 tests for multi-session warning feature
     - Tests disabled-by-default, enabled, committed work, and different base commit scenarios
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_types.go`** (Modified)
     - Added `ShouldResetShadowBranch bool` field to `SessionState`:
     ```go
     ShouldResetShadowBranch  bool            `json:"should_reset_shadow_branch,omitempty"` // True if shadow branch should be reset on next checkpoint (set at prompt start)
     ```
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit.go`** (Modified)
     - Added imports for go-git
     - Implemented `getFilesTouchedByShadow()` helper:
     ```go
     func (s *ManualCommitStrategy) getFilesTouchedByShadow(
         repo *git.Repository,
         shadowBranch string,
     ) ([]string, error) {
         // Gets shadow branch reference
         // Compares shadow tree with base tree
         // Returns list of modified file paths
     }
     ```
     - Implemented `fileSetIntersection()` helper:
     ```go
     func fileSetIntersection(a, b []string) []string {
         // Returns files present in both lists
     }
     ```
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_hooks.go`** (Modified)
     - Implemented `OnPromptStart()` hook (lines ~968-1062):
     ```go
     func (s *ManualCommitStrategy) OnPromptStart(sessionID string) error {
         // Load session state
         // Check if shadow branch exists
         // Get worktree status
         // If clean worktree -> set shouldReset = true
         // Else check overlap with shadow files
         // If no overlap -> set shouldReset = true
         // Else -> set shouldReset = false
         // Save state
     }
     ```
     - Implemented `OnPromptEnd()` hook:
     ```go
     func (s *ManualCommitStrategy) OnPromptEnd(sessionID string) error {
         // Clear ShouldResetShadowBranch flag if still set
         // Ensures fresh check on next prompt
     }
     ```
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_git.go`** (Modified)
     - Modified `SaveChanges()` to check flag and reset shadow branch (after line 58):
     ```go
     // Check if shadow branch should be reset (flag set at prompt start)
     if state.ShouldResetShadowBranch && branchExisted {
         logging.Info(logCtx, "resetting shadow branch (no overlap at prompt start)")
         // Delete the shadow branch
         branchRef := plumbing.NewBranchReferenceName(shadowBranchName)
         repo.Storer.RemoveReference(branchRef)
         // Reset session state for fresh start
         state.CheckpointCount = 0
         state.FilesTouched = nil
         state.PromptAttributions = nil
         branchExisted = false
         state.ShouldResetShadowBranch = false
     }
     ```

4. **Errors and Fixes**:
   - **Test Setup Error**: Tests initially failed because `git restore` requires files to exist in base commit
     - Fixed by adding commits with initial file content before running session tests
     - Example: `env.WriteFile("src/file1.ts", "initial"); env.GitAdd(); env.GitCommit()`
   
   - **Compilation Errors**: Missing imports in `manual_commit.go`
     - Fixed by adding: `"github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"` and `"github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing"`
   
   - **Function Reference Errors**: Used wrong function names initially
     - `s.getSessionState()` -> `s.loadSessionState()` 
     - `checkpoint.GetRepo()` -> `OpenRepository()`

5. **Problem Solving**:
   - **Why check at prompt start?** Critical insight: if we check overlap at checkpoint time and user stashed then worked on same file, we'd incorrectly detect overlap and continue on old shadow branch. Checking before modifications happens ensures we see the clean worktree state.
   - **Test failures show real bug**: Tests correctly expose the ghost files bug where dismissed files remain in shadow branch
   - **Simplification justified**: The suffix approach doesn't solve the stash+new-work scenario either without complex content matching, so single branch is simpler with same coverage

6. **All User Messages**:
   - "Can you read docs/architecture/shadow-branch-suffixes.md, I'd like to modify this approach: I don't think we need suffixes but instead we just use one branch, is there overlap in files we continue, if there is no overlap and the new session did create local changes, then we reset the shadow branch to a clean state. Can you ultrathink about it and come up with a new plan?"
   - "one follow up: in case of "stash" -> new session, reset shadow branch when file changes happen -> can we reliable figure out when those file changes happen? Or would we rather track at the beginning of the new session that there is no overlap and by that keep a flag on the property that anything that would cause a checkpoint on the shadow branch will reset it?"
   - "If the second sessions would create files that do overlap (which is not unlikely) then we still should not continue. There is of course the issue that you do one prompt (no file changes yet, file system has still changes from prior session) and then decide "ok, this is better" and then reset the file directory. So I think at the beginning of a prompt we should do the comparision (are there still changes that belong to the prior session?) and keep that as a state. If there would be a call to SaveChanges during that prompt, then the flag decides what to do, if there isn't the flag is reset and we do another check at the next promp start. Does that make sense?"
   - "yes, update the architecture document first"
   - "Can we not commit the doc/testing docs? I think the `docs/requirement` folder is already gitignored so we could move it there while the work is ongoing?"
   - "yes, but I'd like to do a TDD approach with integration tests, let's first setup integration tests for the scenarios and then we do the implementation."
   - "1+2" (Run tests and start implementation)

7. **Pending Tasks**:
   - Task #6: Wire up hooks to CLI hook handlers (IN PROGRESS)
   - Multi-session warning implementation (not started - from tests but lower priority)
   - Run integration tests after wiring to verify implementation works

8. **Current Work**:
   I was working on Task #6: wiring up the new `OnPromptStart()` and `OnPromptEnd()` hooks to the CLI hook registry. Specifically, I was examining `cmd/entire/cli/hook_registry.go` to understand how hooks are registered. I found:
   - Line 65: `RegisterHookHandler(agent.AgentNameClaudeCode, claudecode.HookNameUserPromptSubmit, func() error { ... return captureInitialState() })`
   - The current user-prompt-submit hook calls `captureInitialState()`
   - I need to add a call to strategy's `OnPromptStart()` method in the appropriate hook handler
   - Also need to find where/if there's a prompt-end hook to wire up `OnPromptEnd()`

9. **Optional Next Step**:
   Complete Task #6 by modifying the hook handlers to call the new strategy methods. Specifically:
   
   From the current work: "I was finding where to register the new hooks in the hook registry when the summary was requested."
   
   The next concrete step is to:
   1. Find or examine the `captureInitialState()` function in `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go`
   2. Add a call to `strategy.OnPromptStart(entireSessionID)` in the user-prompt-submit hook handler
   3. Find if there's a prompt-end hook (or determine if we need to call `OnPromptEnd()` in the Stop hook as a fallback)
   4. Run the integration tests to verify the implementation works: `mise run test:integration | grep TestShadowBranchOverlap`
   
   This directly continues the implementation work that was interrupted by the summary request.

Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

---

no, it should be worktree (based on the commit that is HEAD and which the branch is named of) + the new changes done by session 2

---

the tests are wrong then, sorry I missed this. 1 is correct

---

can you summarize me the changes to soph/improved-shadow in a few sentences

---

is this implementation now feature complete?

---

no let's refactor the warning too as outlined in the spec

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation started with a summary of previous work on implementing shadow branch overlap detection for the manual-commit strategy. The user then asked me to summarize changes to the `soph/improved-shadow` branch.

2. **Summary Request**: I provided a brief summary explaining the shadow branch overlap detection feature that fixes the "ghost files" bug.

3. **Feature Completeness Question**: User asked if the implementation is feature complete. I identified that the core overlap detection was complete but the multi-session warning feature (opt-in) from the architecture doc was not implemented.

4. **Refactoring Request**: User explicitly requested: "no let's refactor the warning too as outlined in the spec" - meaning I need to refactor the existing multi-session warning from opt-out (default ON) to opt-in (default OFF) as specified in the architecture document.

5. **My Approach**: I read the architecture document and existing test files to understand the spec, then started refactoring:
   - Changed `IsMultiSessionWarningDisabled()` to `IsMultiSessionWarningEnabled()`
   - Changed setting from `disable_multisession_warning` to `enable_multisession_warning`
   - Started inverting logic in call sites
   - Started updating CLI flag from `--disable-multisession-warning` to `--enable-multisession-warning`

6. **Current State**: I was in the middle of refactoring `setup.go`, having:
   - Renamed the variable from `disableMultisessionWarning` to `enableMultisessionWarning`
   - Updated the flag definition
   - But haven't yet updated all the usages of the old variable name, causing compilation errors

The user's request is clear: refactor the multi-session warning to be opt-in (disabled by default) instead of opt-out (enabled by default), following the architecture specification.

Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
   - User asked for a summary of changes to the `soph/improved-shadow` branch
   - User asked if the implementation was feature complete
   - User explicitly requested: "no let's refactor the warning too as outlined in the spec" - refactor the existing multi-session warning from opt-out (default ON) to opt-in (default OFF) as specified in `docs/architecture/shadow-branch-overlap.md`
   - The refactoring involves:
     - Renaming `IsMultiSessionWarningDisabled()` to `IsMultiSessionWarningEnabled()`
     - Changing setting key from `disable_multisession_warning` to `enable_multisession_warning`
     - Inverting all logic (from checking if disabled to checking if enabled)
     - Changing CLI flag from `--disable-multisession-warning` to `--enable-multisession-warning`
     - Making warnings disabled by default (opt-in feature)

2. **Key Technical Concepts**:
   - Shadow branch overlap detection for manual-commit strategy
   - Ghost files bug (dismissed files remaining in shadow branch)
   - Multi-session warning system (opt-in vs opt-out)
   - Strategy pattern with optional interfaces (`PromptHooks`, `ConcurrentSessionChecker`)
   - Git hooks for Claude Code and Gemini CLI
   - Settings management with JSON configuration files
   - Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach

3. **Files and Code Sections**:

   - **`docs/architecture/shadow-branch-overlap.md`**
     - Architecture specification for multi-session warning
     - Specifies opt-in behavior (default: disabled)
     - Setting name: `enable_multisession_warning` (not `disable_multisession_warning`)
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/config.go`** (Modified)
     - Changed function name and logic:
     ```go
     // IsMultiSessionWarningEnabled checks if multi-session warnings are enabled.
     // Returns false (hide warnings) by default if settings cannot be loaded or the key is missing.
     // This is an opt-in feature - users must explicitly enable it.
     func IsMultiSessionWarningEnabled() bool {
         settings, err := LoadEntireSettings()
         if err != nil {
             return false // Default: warnings disabled
         }
         if settings.StrategyOptions == nil {
             return false
         }
         if enabled, ok := settings.StrategyOptions["enable_multisession_warning"].(bool); ok {
             return enabled
         }
         return false // Default: warnings disabled
     }
     ```
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go`** (Modified)
     - Updated `checkConcurrentSessions()`:
     ```go
     // Check if warnings are enabled via settings (opt-in feature, disabled by default)
     if !IsMultiSessionWarningEnabled() {
         return false, nil
     }
     ```
     - Updated `handleSessionInitErrors()`:
     ```go
     // If multi-session warnings are not enabled, skip this error silently
     // (Warnings are opt-in, disabled by default)
     if !IsMultiSessionWarningEnabled() {
         return nil
     }
     ```
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_geminicli_handlers.go`** (Modified)
     - Updated `checkConcurrentSessionsGemini()`:
     ```go
     // Check if warnings are enabled via settings (opt-in feature, disabled by default)
     if !IsMultiSessionWarningEnabled() {
         return
     }
     ```
     
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/setup.go`** (Partially Modified)
     - Changed variable name in `newEnableCmd()`:
     ```go
     var enableMultisessionWarning bool
     ```
     - Updated flag definition:
     ```go
     cmd.Flags().BoolVar(&enableMultisessionWarning, "enable-multisession-warning", false, "Enable warnings when multiple sessions are active on the same commit (opt-in)")
     ```
     - Still has compilation errors due to unreplaced usages of old variable name `disableMultisessionWarning` in:
       - Line 79: `setupAgentHooksNonInteractive()` call
       - Line 83: `runEnableWithStrategy()` call  
       - Line 85: `runEnableInteractive()` call
       - Lines 164, 217, 290, 335, 599, 647: Function signatures and implementations

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/multi_session_warning_test.go`**
     - Contains 4 tests for multi-session warning behavior
     - Tests expect `enable_multisession_warning` setting key (matches new spec)
     - Need to be verified after refactoring is complete

4. **Errors and Fixes**:
   - **Compilation errors in `setup.go`**: Variable `disableMultisessionWarning` is undefined after renaming to `enableMultisessionWarning`
     - Not yet fixed - this is where work stopped
     - Need to replace all occurrences of `disableMultisessionWarning` with `enableMultisessionWarning`
     - Need to invert the logic where the variable is used (setting to true becomes setting to true, but the key changes from `disable_multisession_warning` to `enable_multisession_warning`)

5. **Problem Solving**:
   - Successfully implemented shadow branch overlap detection with all 5 integration tests passing
   - Fixed test expectations to match correct behavior (shadow branch = HEAD tree + session changes)
   - Identified that multi-session warning needs to be refactored from opt-out to opt-in
   - Started systematic refactoring: config function → hook call sites → CLI setup
   - Currently blocked on completing the setup.go refactoring due to unreplaced variable references

6. **All User Messages**:
   - "can you summarize me the changes to soph/improved-shadow in a few sentences"
   - "is this implementation now feature complete?"
   - "no let's refactor the warning too as outlined in the spec"

7. **Pending Tasks**:
   - Task #1 (in progress): Refactor multi-session warning to opt-in
     - Complete refactoring of `setup.go` (replace all `disableMultisessionWarning` with `enableMultisessionWarning`)
     - Update logic where the setting is applied (change key from `disable_multisession_warning` to `enable_multisession_warning`)
     - Run tests to verify the refactoring works correctly

8. **Current Work**:
   I was refactoring the multi-session warning system from opt-out to opt-in as specified in the architecture document. Specifically, I was working on `cmd/entire/cli/setup.go`:
   
   - Renamed the flag variable from `disableMultisessionWarning` to `enableMultisessionWarning`
   - Updated the flag definition to use the new name
   - Started getting compilation errors because the old variable name is still used in multiple places:
     - Function signatures for `setupAgentHooksNonInteractive()`, `runEnableWithStrategy()`, `runEnableInteractive()`
     - Multiple places where the setting is applied to `settings.StrategyOptions["disable_multisession_warning"]` (needs to change to `enable_multisession_warning`)
   
   The task was interrupted mid-refactoring with compilation errors that need to be fixed by completing the variable rename and updating the setting key throughout the file.

9. **Optional Next Step**:
   Complete the refactoring of `setup.go` by:
   1. Replace all remaining occurrences of `disableMultisessionWarning` parameter with `enableMultisessionWarning`
   2. Update all places where `settings.StrategyOptions["disable_multisession_warning"]` is set to use `settings.StrategyOptions["enable_multisession_warning"]` instead
   3. Verify the code compiles successfully
   4. Run the multi-session warning tests to ensure the refactoring works correctly
   
   Direct quote from conversation showing the task: User said "no let's refactor the warning too as outlined in the spec" in response to my question about whether the implementation was feature complete. I was in the middle of this refactoring work when the summary was requested, specifically fixing compilation errors in setup.go after renaming variables and flags.
