Looking at GetSessionLog in manual_commit_logs it's currently has a parameter "commitHash" but then it's also used as a CheckpointID. I'd like to refactor this so the method is either accepting a commitHash (typed, not a string) or a CheckpointID directly. Can you propose what is best?

---

If we would remove the Session-ID logic (since it's not needed anymore) would that change anything?

---

can you also check: auto commit has the same methods, or uses the one from manual-commit?

---

is the GetSessionLog method used in manual-commit strategy to look at the shadow branches?

---

Operation stopped by hook: Another session is active: "I got this feedback for the changes in the local branch: ..."

You can continue here, but checkpoints from both sessions will be interleaved.

To resume the other session instead, exit Claude and run: claude -r ab8c5aa0-e11b-4b16-9be3-c470a9483829

To suppress this warning in future sessions, run:
  entire enable --disable-multisession-warning

Press the up arrow key to get your prompt back.

---

could we use the regexp from the id package? or is that risky because circular dependencies?

---

ok, getting back to only GetSessionLog, so for the `Entire-Metadata` logic we need a distinct method, and then couldn't we move `GetSessionLog` out of the strategies and have just one implemenation?

---

ok, let's do this

---

how does the shadow branch log retrieval now works? (for rewinding)

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked about refactoring `GetSessionLog` in `manual_commit_logs.go` because the parameter is named "commitHash" but used as a CheckpointID. They wanted clarity on whether to accept a typed commit hash or CheckpointID directly.

2. **Analysis Phase**: I read the relevant files:
   - `manual_commit_logs.go` - contains the polymorphic `GetSessionLog` that tries checkpoint ID, commit ref, session ID
   - `auto_commit.go` - simpler implementation that just does checkpoint lookup
   - `trailers/trailers.go` - has `ParseCheckpoint` returning `id.CheckpointID`
   - `checkpoint/id/id.go` - defines `CheckpointID` type (12 hex chars)

3. **Initial Recommendation**: I proposed adding a typed method while keeping backward compatibility with separate methods.

4. **User Follow-up**: User asked if removing session ID logic would change anything.

5. **Updated Recommendation**: With session ID removed, I recommended just accepting `id.CheckpointID` only, making callers extract checkpoint IDs themselves.

6. **User Question**: Asked if auto-commit has same methods or uses manual-commit's.

7. **My Finding**: Both strategies have separate implementations, but they're nearly identical - both use `checkpoint.GitStore.ReadCommitted()`.

8. **User Insight**: Suggested moving `GetSessionLog` out of strategies to have one implementation, with a distinct method for `Entire-Metadata` (shadow branch) logic.

9. **Implementation Started**: User said "ok, let's do this" and I began the refactoring.

10. **Key Changes Made**:
    - Added `GetSessionLog(cpID id.CheckpointID)` to `checkpoint.GitStore`
    - Added `LookupSessionLog(cpID)` convenience function
    - Added `ErrCheckpointNotFound` and `ErrNoTranscript` errors
    - Removed `GetSessionLog` from Strategy interface
    - Removed implementations from both strategies
    - Updated callers in `resume.go`, `session.go`, `rewind.go`

11. **User Question About Shadow Branch**: User asked "how does the shadow branch log retrieval now works? (for rewinding)"

12. **Issue Identified**: I traced through and found that shadow branch checkpoints (uncommitted) don't have a CheckpointID, so the new flow fails for them. The fallback to local files only works if the session is active.

13. **Fix Started**: I added `GetTranscriptFromCommit` to `checkpoint/temporary.go` and started updating `rewind.go` with `restoreSessionTranscriptFromShadow` function.

Key files modified:
- `checkpoint/checkpoint.go` - added errors
- `checkpoint/committed.go` - added `GetSessionLog`, `LookupSessionLog`
- `checkpoint/temporary.go` - added `GetTranscriptFromCommit`
- `strategy/strategy.go` - removed `GetSessionLog` from interface
- `strategy/auto_commit.go` - removed `GetSessionLog` and `getSessionLogLegacy`
- `strategy/manual_commit_logs.go` - removed `GetSessionLog`, `getSessionLogBySessionID`, `getSessionLogFromShadow`
- `rewind.go` - updated to use new checkpoint package, added shadow branch functions
- `resume.go` - updated to use checkpoint package
- `session.go` - updated to use checkpoint package

Errors encountered:
- Missing `strategy` import in resume.go after adding checkpoint imports
- Unused `strat` variable in session.go after refactoring
- Linter error about returning nil when err is not nil

Current state: I just added `restoreSessionTranscriptFromShadow` and `writeTranscriptToAgentSession` to rewind.go but haven't updated the callers to use the shadow branch fallback.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user wanted to refactor `GetSessionLog` in `manual_commit_logs.go` because the parameter was named "commitHash" but was being used polymorphically as a CheckpointID, commit hash, or session ID. The goal was to:
   - Use typed `id.CheckpointID` instead of a string
   - Move the session log lookup out of the Strategy interface into the checkpoint package
   - Keep shadow branch lookup as a separate method for manual-commit strategy
   - Remove the session ID fallback logic (no longer needed)

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - `id.CheckpointID` - 12-character hex identifier for checkpoints
   - `checkpoint.GitStore` - handles checkpoint storage on `entire/sessions` branch
   - Shadow branches (`entire/<commit-hash>`) - store uncommitted checkpoints for manual-commit strategy
   - Committed checkpoints - stored on `entire/sessions` branch with sharded paths
   - Strategy interface - defines common operations for auto-commit and manual-commit strategies

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`checkpoint/checkpoint.go`** - Added error types for checkpoint operations
     ```go
     var (
         ErrCheckpointNotFound = errors.New("checkpoint not found")
         ErrNoTranscript = errors.New("no transcript found for checkpoint")
     )
     ```

   - **`checkpoint/committed.go`** - Added typed `GetSessionLog` and convenience function
     ```go
     func (s *GitStore) GetSessionLog(cpID id.CheckpointID) ([]byte, string, error) {
         result, err := s.ReadCommitted(context.Background(), cpID.String())
         if err != nil {
             return nil, "", fmt.Errorf("failed to read checkpoint: %w", err)
         }
         if result == nil {
             return nil, "", ErrCheckpointNotFound
         }
         if len(result.Transcript) == 0 {
             return nil, "", ErrNoTranscript
         }
         return result.Transcript, result.Metadata.SessionID, nil
     }

     func LookupSessionLog(cpID id.CheckpointID) ([]byte, string, error) {
         repo, err := git.PlainOpenWithOptions(".", &git.PlainOpenOptions{DetectDotGit: true})
         if err != nil {
             return nil, "", fmt.Errorf("failed to open git repository: %w", err)
         }
         store := NewGitStore(repo)
         return store.GetSessionLog(cpID)
     }
     ```

   - **`checkpoint/temporary.go`** - Added method to read transcripts from shadow branch commits
     ```go
     func (s *GitStore) GetTranscriptFromCommit(commitHash plumbing.Hash, metadataDir string) ([]byte, error) {
         commit, err := s.repo.CommitObject(commitHash)
         if err != nil {
             return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to get commit: %w", err)
         }
         tree, err := commit.Tree()
         if err != nil {
             return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to get commit tree: %w", err)
         }
         // Try current format first, then legacy
         transcriptPath := metadataDir + "/" + paths.TranscriptFileName
         if file, fileErr := tree.File(transcriptPath); fileErr == nil {
             content, contentErr := file.Contents()
             if contentErr == nil {
                 return []byte(content), nil
             }
         }
         transcriptPath = metadataDir + "/" + paths.TranscriptFileNameLegacy
         if file, fileErr := tree.File(transcriptPath); fileErr == nil {
             content, contentErr := file.Contents()
             if contentErr == nil {
                 return []byte(content), nil
             }
         }
         return nil, ErrNoTranscript
     }
     ```

   - **`strategy/strategy.go`** - Removed `GetSessionLog` from interface (lines 378-381 removed)

   - **`strategy/auto_commit.go`** - Removed `GetSessionLog` and `getSessionLogLegacy` methods (~80 lines)

   - **`strategy/manual_commit_logs.go`** - Removed `GetSessionLog`, `getSessionLogBySessionID`, `getSessionLogFromShadow` (~160 lines). File now starts with `GetTaskCheckpoint`.

   - **`rewind.go`** - Updated with new functions for transcript restoration:
     ```go
     func restoreSessionTranscriptFromStrategy(checkpointID, sessionID string, agent agentpkg.Agent) (string, error) {
         cpID, err := id.NewCheckpointID(checkpointID)
         if err != nil {
             return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid checkpoint ID: %w", err)
         }
         content, returnedSessionID, err := checkpoint.LookupSessionLog(cpID)
         if err != nil {
             return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to get session log: %w", err)
         }
         if returnedSessionID != "" {
             sessionID = returnedSessionID
         }
         return writeTranscriptToAgentSession(content, sessionID, agent)
     }

     func restoreSessionTranscriptFromShadow(commitHash, metadataDir, sessionID string, agent agentpkg.Agent) (string, error) {
         repo, err := git.PlainOpenWithOptions(".", &git.PlainOpenOptions{DetectDotGit: true})
         if err != nil {
             return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to open repository: %w", err)
         }
         hash := plumbing.NewHash(commitHash)
         if hash.IsZero() {
             return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid commit hash: %s", commitHash)
         }
         store := checkpoint.NewGitStore(repo)
         content, err := store.GetTranscriptFromCommit(hash, metadataDir)
         if err != nil {
             return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to get transcript from shadow branch: %w", err)
         }
         return writeTranscriptToAgentSession(content, sessionID, agent)
     }

     func writeTranscriptToAgentSession(content []byte, sessionID string, agent agentpkg.Agent) (string, error) {
         // ... writes transcript to agent's session storage
     }
     ```

   - **`resume.go`** - Updated to use `checkpoint.LookupSessionLog(cpID)` with proper ID validation

   - **`session.go`** - Updated `runSessionRaw` and `restoreAgentSession` to use checkpoint package

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Missing strategy import in resume.go**: After adding checkpoint imports, I accidentally removed the strategy import. Fixed by adding it back.
   - **Unused strat variable in session.go**: After refactoring `restoreAgentSession` to not take strategy parameter, the caller still declared `strat := GetStrategy()`. Fixed by removing the unused declaration.
   - **Linter error (nilerr)**: `restoreAgentSession` returned nil when `id.NewCheckpointID` failed. Fixed by adding `//nolint:nilerr` comment since this is intentional (skip restoration for invalid checkpoint IDs).

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Completed**: Refactored `GetSessionLog` to use typed `CheckpointID`, moved to checkpoint package, updated all callers
   - **In Progress**: Shadow branch transcript retrieval for rewinding uncommitted checkpoints. Added `GetTranscriptFromCommit` and `restoreSessionTranscriptFromShadow` but haven't updated the callers in rewind.go to use the shadow branch fallback.

6. All user messages:
   - "Looking at GetSessionLog in manual_commit_logs it's currently has a parameter "commitHash" but then it's also used as a CheckpointID. I'd like to refactor this so the method is either accepting a commitHash (typed, not a string) or a CheckpointID directly. Can you propose what is best?"
   - "If we would remove the Session-ID logic (since it's not needed anymore) would that change anything?"
   - "can you also check: auto commit has the same methods, or uses the one from manual-commit?"
   - "ok, getting back to only GetSessionLog, so for the `Entire-Metadata` logic we need a distinct method, and then couldn't we move `GetSessionLog` out of the strategies and have just one implemenation?"
   - "ok, let's do this"
   - "how does the shadow branch log retrieval now works? (for rewinding)"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Update the callers in `rewind.go` to use `restoreSessionTranscriptFromShadow` as a fallback when `restoreSessionTranscriptFromStrategy` fails for shadow branch checkpoints (no valid checkpoint ID)
   - Run tests to verify the shadow branch retrieval works

8. Current Work:
   The user asked "how does the shadow branch log retrieval now works? (for rewinding)" - I identified that the refactoring broke shadow branch transcript retrieval. For uncommitted checkpoints:
   - `CheckpointID` is empty
   - Falls back to commit hash (40 chars) which fails `id.NewCheckpointID` validation
   - Falls back to local file which only works for active sessions
   
   I added:
   - `GetTranscriptFromCommit` to `checkpoint/temporary.go` to read from shadow branch commit trees
   - `restoreSessionTranscriptFromShadow` to `rewind.go` to use this new method
   - `writeTranscriptToAgentSession` helper to share code between the two restore functions
   
   But I haven't yet updated the callers (the code at lines 346-362 and 543-557 in `rewind.go`) to try the shadow branch fallback.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Update the callers in `rewind.go` to use `restoreSessionTranscriptFromShadow` when `restoreSessionTranscriptFromStrategy` fails. The current code at line 352 is:
   ```go
   if returnedSessionID, err := restoreSessionTranscriptFromStrategy(lookupID, sessionID, agent); err != nil {
       // Fall back to local file
       if err := restoreSessionTranscript(transcriptFile, sessionID, agent); err != nil {
   ```
   This needs to try shadow branch lookup before falling back to local file, using `selectedPoint.ID` (commit hash) and `selectedPoint.MetadataDir`.

Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

---

could we use the typed CheckpointId inside RewindPoint?

---

can we use `checkpointID` instead of `cpID` in cmd/entire/cli/session.go

---

can you stage me the changes around checkpointID types and unstage the one around the GetSessionLog refactor?

---

sorry I messed up, can you do it again

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context (from previous session summary)**:
   - User asked to refactor `GetSessionLog` in `manual_commit_logs.go` to use typed `id.CheckpointID` instead of string
   - This evolved into moving `GetSessionLog` out of strategies to the checkpoint package
   - Added shadow branch transcript retrieval for rewinding uncommitted checkpoints

2. **Current Session - First Request**:
   - User asked if we could use typed `id.CheckpointID` inside `RewindPoint`
   - I confirmed this was possible since `id.CheckpointID` has `.IsEmpty()` method and `EmptyCheckpointID` constant

3. **Implementation of Typed CheckpointID**:
   - Updated `RewindPoint.CheckpointID` from `string` to `id.CheckpointID` in `strategy/strategy.go`
   - Updated `Checkpoint.CheckpointID` from `string` to `id.CheckpointID` in `strategy/session.go`
   - Fixed all compilation errors across multiple files by:
     - Adding `id` package imports
     - Changing `== ""` comparisons to `.IsEmpty()`
     - Adding `.String()` calls where string values needed
     - Using `.Path()` instead of `paths.CheckpointPath()`
     - Converting string values to typed IDs with `id.CheckpointID(stringValue)`

4. **Files Modified for Type Changes**:
   - `strategy/strategy.go` - type change + import
   - `strategy/session.go` - type change + import + usage updates
   - `strategy/auto_commit.go` - `.IsEmpty()`, `.String()`, `.Path()` changes
   - `strategy/manual_commit_logs.go` - same pattern
   - `strategy/manual_commit_rewind.go` - type conversions
   - `strategy/session_test.go` - test comparison update
   - `rewind.go` - function signatures, checks
   - `session.go` - function signatures, checks
   - `resume.go` - type conversion
   - `explain.go` - `.String()` call

5. **User Request to Rename Variable**:
   - User asked to rename `cpID` to `checkpointID` in `cmd/entire/cli/session.go`
   - I made this change in the `restoreAgentSession` function

6. **Git Staging Request**:
   - User asked to stage changes around checkpointID types and unstage the GetSessionLog refactor changes
   - I attempted partial staging using `git add -p`
   - User said they "messed up" and asked me to redo it
   - I reset the staging with `git reset HEAD`
   - Currently in the middle of re-staging the type-related changes

7. **Current Staging Progress**:
   - Staged pure type files: `explain.go`, `session_test.go`, `manual_commit_rewind.go`, `strategy/session.go`
   - Staged partial `strategy/strategy.go` (type change, not interface removal)
   - Currently processing `auto_commit.go` - staged type hunks (1, 3-7), skipped GetSessionLog deletion (hunk 2)
   - Still need to handle: `manual_commit_logs.go`, `rewind.go`, `resume.go`, `session.go`

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Refactor `CheckpointID` fields from `string` to typed `id.CheckpointID` in `RewindPoint` and `Checkpoint` structs
   - Update all code that uses these fields to use `.IsEmpty()`, `.String()`, and `.Path()` methods
   - Stage ONLY the checkpointID type changes, leaving the GetSessionLog refactor changes unstaged
   - The two refactors (typed IDs and GetSessionLog move) are intertwined but user wants them in separate commits

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - `id.CheckpointID` - typed wrapper around string with validation (12 hex chars)
   - `.IsEmpty()` method to check for empty checkpoint IDs
   - `.String()` method for string conversion
   - `.Path()` method for sharded storage paths
   - Partial git staging with `git add -p` to separate intertwined changes
   - GetSessionLog refactor moved session log lookup from Strategy interface to checkpoint package

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **`strategy/strategy.go`** - Type change in RewindPoint struct
     ```go
     // CheckpointID is the stable 12-hex-char identifier for logs-only points.
     // Empty for shadow branch checkpoints (uncommitted).
     CheckpointID id.CheckpointID
     ```
   
   - **`strategy/session.go`** - Type change in Checkpoint struct + usage updates
     ```go
     type Checkpoint struct {
         CheckpointID id.CheckpointID
         // ...
     }
     ```
   
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/session.go`** - Function signature updated
     ```go
     func restoreAgentSession(ag agent.Agent, sessionID string, checkpointID id.CheckpointID) error {
         // ...
         logContent, _, err := checkpoint.LookupSessionLog(checkpointID)
     }
     ```
   
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/rewind.go`** - Function signature and checks updated
     ```go
     func restoreSessionTranscriptFromStrategy(cpID id.CheckpointID, sessionID string, agent agentpkg.Agent) (string, error) {
         content, returnedSessionID, err := checkpoint.LookupSessionLog(cpID)
         // ...
     }
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Compilation errors after type change**: Many files failed to compile due to type mismatches
     - Fixed by adding `.String()` calls where strings were expected
     - Fixed by changing `== ""` to `.IsEmpty()`
     - Fixed by converting strings to typed IDs with `id.CheckpointID(str)`
   - **Test failure in session_test.go**: Comparison `sess.Checkpoints[0].CheckpointID != checkpointID` failed due to type mismatch
     - Fixed by adding `.String()`: `sess.Checkpoints[0].CheckpointID.String() != checkpointID`

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully refactored all CheckpointID usages from string to typed id.CheckpointID
   - All tests pass and linter reports no issues
   - Currently solving: separating two intertwined refactors for separate git commits using partial staging

6. All user messages:
   - "could we use the typed CheckpointId inside RewindPoint?"
   - "can we use `checkpointID` instead of `cpID` in cmd/entire/cli/session.go"
   - "can you stage me the changes around checkpointID types and unstage the one around the GetSessionLog refactor?"
   - "sorry I messed up, can you do it again"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete the partial git staging to separate type changes from GetSessionLog refactor
   - Still need to process: `manual_commit_logs.go`, `rewind.go`, `resume.go`, `session.go` (cli package)

8. Current Work:
   User asked to redo the git staging after saying "sorry I messed up". I reset all staged changes with `git reset HEAD` and started re-staging. Currently in the middle of staging type-related hunks:
   - ✅ Staged: `explain.go`, `session_test.go`, `manual_commit_rewind.go`, `strategy/session.go`
   - ✅ Staged: `strategy/strategy.go` (hunks 1-2: import + type change, skipped hunk 3: interface removal)
   - ✅ Just processed: `auto_commit.go` (staged hunks 1,3-7 for type changes, skipped hunk 2 for GetSessionLog deletion)
   - ⏳ Still need: `manual_commit_logs.go`, `rewind.go`, `resume.go`, `session.go`

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue staging type-related changes for `manual_commit_logs.go` (stage type hunks 3-4, skip import removal hunk 1 and GetSessionLog deletion hunk 2):
   ```
   printf 'n\nn\ny\ny\n' | git add -p cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_logs.go
   ```
   Then handle `rewind.go`, `resume.go`, and `session.go` similarly.
