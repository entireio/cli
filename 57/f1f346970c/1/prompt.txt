can you review the e2e integration tests in cmd/entire/cli/e2e_test if they are testing the right things and are in line with other documentation in the repo?

---

yeah let's update CLAUDE.md but make sure that claude should ask or specifically be told to run the e2e tests since they consume tokens

---

2. Strengthen auto-commit tests - Add ValidateCheckpoint calls

---

3. Make logs-only rewind test deterministic - Assert specific expected behavior

---

4. Consider adding worktree e2e test if this is a critical path 

This is a good point, can you check which are worth to ask? And give me suggestions first?

---

yes, do 1
