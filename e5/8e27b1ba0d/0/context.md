# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Can you look again, the CLAUDE.md updated and in an checkpoint commit in entire/sessions can now be multiple sessions, can you add support for that?

### Prompt 2

when is the session shown as green / active? what's the condition for that?

### Prompt 3

can you go to /Users/soph/Work/entire/test/test1234 and try to figure out why both sessions here are shown green: 

Entire Checkpoints


  v main *  [1 checkpoints]
>   v - 05fdd18 should include two sessions (2 steps) <active>
        * Session: 2026-01-13-7bf322a0 - can you make the output green
        * Session: 2026-01-13-d488d465 - Archived session

### Prompt 4

yeah please check, I have one of the claude sessions still open but didn't run a prompt, so I think when doing the `git commit` with the trailer it should have still cleaned both, right?

### Prompt 5

let's go with option 1

### Prompt 6

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This is a continuation from a previous conversation about refactoring `entire list` command to change the hierarchy from Branch → Session → Checkpoint to Branch → Checkpoint → Session.

2. **Hierarchy Refactor Completion**: The conversation starts with me continuing the refactor work...

### Prompt 7

which one of the two is the newer session?

### Prompt 8

Can we sort the session that the newest is on top
