TestResume_LocalLogNewerTimestamp <- I think there's a problem with this integration test where it expects some input from the command line to continue - it's in `cmd/entire/cli/integration_test/resume_test.go`

---

when you run it, are you in non-interactive mode?

when I run it via `go test -v --tags=integration ./cmd/entire/cli/integration_test -run TestResume_LocalLogNewerTimestamp` it seems to hang until I hit enter

let's break out a new branch first please

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

can we talk about what we're doing first?

---

which line in the code is prompting the user interactively?

---

so...if we're reading this correctly, the `env.RunResume` does nothing right now, yeah?

---

if there were a way to test the interactive form, then in theory we could split this test yeah?

---

but we are missing 'we show the user an interactive prompt to proceed' (both yes and no cases)?

---

okay, let's do the split as you've detailed above first
