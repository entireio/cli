can you check In CalculateAttributionWithAccumulated, TotalCommitted and AgentLines don't account for user removals of agent lines. When a user removes lines the agent added, totalCommitted is calculated as totalAgentAdded + pureUserAdded without subtracting pureUserRemoved. For example, if the agent adds 10 lines and the user removes 5 of them and adds 2 new ones, the commit has 7 net lines but TotalCommitted reports 10, and AgentPercentage reports 100% instead of ~71%. The simpler CalculateAttribution function correctly uses the actual commit diff for this calculation, but the production function does not.
