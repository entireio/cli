the new logging feature writes to `.entire/logs` we should include that in the .gitignore in .entire

---

sorry, my point is: the entire cli writes the `.entire/.gitignore` when doing `entire enable` and that is not including the logs folder right now

---

when is EnsureMetadataGitignore run?

---

hmm, I'm wondering now why we are only adding some in EnsureMetadataGitIgnore and why we have this in two places instead of making setup call that too and it covers everything?

---

yes
