Commit Message: Run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Prompts

### Prompt 1

run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Summary

I misread the `ls` output and thought `docs/color.md` was missing. My apologies. I'll remove `docs/blue.md` and append its content to the existing `docs/color.md` file to correct my mistake.
