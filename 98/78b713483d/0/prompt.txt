# Review Command

<command_purpose> Perform exhaustive code reviews using multi-agent analysis, ultra-thinking, and Git worktrees for deep local inspection. </command_purpose>

## Introduction

<role>Senior Code Review Architect with expertise in security, performance, architecture, and quality assurance</role>

## Prerequisites

<requirements>
- Git repository with GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Clean main/master branch
- Proper permissions to create worktrees and access the repository
- For document reviews: Path to a markdown file or document
</requirements>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Determine Review Target & Setup (ALWAYS FIRST)

<review_target> #https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/2 </review_target>

<thinking>
First, I need to determine the review target type and set up the code for analysis.
</thinking>

#### Immediate Actions:

<task_list>

- [ ] Determine review type: PR number (numeric), GitHub URL, file path (.md), or empty (current branch)
- [ ] Check current git branch
- [ ] If ALREADY on the PR branch → proceed with analysis on current branch
- [ ] If DIFFERENT branch → offer to use worktree: "Use git-worktree skill for isolated Call `skill: git-worktree` with branch name
- [ ] Fetch PR metadata using `gh pr view --json` for title, body, files, linked issues
- [ ] Set up language-specific analysis tools
- [ ] Prepare security scanning environment
- [ ] Make sure we are on the branch we are reviewing. Use gh pr checkout to switch to the branch or manually checkout the branch.

Ensure that the code is ready for analysis (either in worktree or on current branch). ONLY then proceed to the next step.

</task_list>

#### Parallel Agents to review the PR:

<parallel_tasks>

Run ALL or most of these agents at the same time:

1. Task kieran-rails-reviewer(PR content)
2. Task dhh-rails-reviewer(PR title)
3. If turbo is used: Task rails-turbo-expert(PR content)
4. Task git-history-analyzer(PR content)
5. Task dependency-detective(PR content)
6. Task pattern-recognition-specialist(PR content)
7. Task architecture-strategist(PR content)
8. Task code-philosopher(PR content)
9. Task security-sentinel(PR content)
10. Task performance-oracle(PR content)
11. Task devops-harmony-analyst(PR content)
12. Task data-integrity-guardian(PR content)
13. Task agent-native-reviewer(PR content) - Verify new features are agent-accessible

</parallel_tasks>

#### Conditional Agents (Run if applicable):

<conditional_agents>

These agents are run ONLY when the PR matches specific criteria. Check the PR files list to determine if they apply:

**If PR contains database migrations (db/migrate/*.rb files) or data backfills:**

14. Task data-migration-expert(PR content) - Validates ID mappings match production, checks for swapped values, verifies rollback safety
15. Task deployment-verification-agent(PR content) - Creates Go/No-Go deployment checklist with SQL verification queries

**When to run migration agents:**
- PR includes files matching `db/migrate/*.rb`
- PR modifies columns that store IDs, enums, or mappings
- PR includes data backfill scripts or rake tasks
- PR changes how data is read/written (e.g., changing from FK to string column)
- PR title/body mentions: migration, backfill, data transformation, ID mapping

**What these agents check:**
- `data-migration-expert`: Verifies hard-coded mappings match production reality (prevents swapped IDs), checks for orphaned associations, validates dual-write patterns
- `deployment-verification-agent`: Produces executable pre/post-deploy checklists with SQL queries, rollback procedures, and monitoring plans

</conditional_agents>

### 4. Ultra-Thinking Deep Dive Phases

<ultrathink_instruction> For each phase below, spend maximum cognitive effort. Think step by step. Consider all angles. Question assumptions. And bring all reviews in a synthesis to the user.</ultrathink_instruction>

<deliverable>
Complete system context map with component interactions
</deliverable>

#### Phase 3: Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Put yourself in each stakeholder's shoes. What matters to them? What are their pain points? </thinking_prompt>

<stakeholder_perspectives>

1. **Developer Perspective** <questions>

   - How easy is this to understand and modify?
   - Are the APIs intuitive?
   - Is debugging straightforward?
   - Can I test this easily? </questions>

2. **Operations Perspective** <questions>

   - How do I deploy this safely?
   - What metrics and logs are available?
   - How do I troubleshoot issues?
   - What are the resource requirements? </questions>

3. **End User Perspective** <questions>

   - Is the feature intuitive?
   - Are error messages helpful?
   - Is performance acceptable?
   - Does it solve my problem? </questions>

4. **Security Team Perspective** <questions>

   - What's the attack surface?
   - Are there compliance requirements?
   - How is data protected?
   - What are the audit capabilities? </questions>

5. **Business Perspective** <questions>
   - What's the ROI?
   - Are there legal/compliance risks?
   - How does this affect time-to-market?
   - What's the total cost of ownership? </questions> </stakeholder_perspectives>

#### Phase 4: Scenario Exploration

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Explore edge cases and failure scenarios. What could go wrong? How does the system behave under stress? </thinking_prompt>

<scenario_checklist>

- [ ] **Happy Path**: Normal operation with valid inputs
- [ ] **Invalid Inputs**: Null, empty, malformed data
- [ ] **Boundary Conditions**: Min/max values, empty collections
- [ ] **Concurrent Access**: Race conditions, deadlocks
- [ ] **Scale Testing**: 10x, 100x, 1000x normal load
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Timeouts, partial failures
- [ ] **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory, disk, connections
- [ ] **Security Attacks**: Injection, overflow, DoS
- [ ] **Data Corruption**: Partial writes, inconsistency
- [ ] **Cascading Failures**: Downstream service issues </scenario_checklist>

### 4. Simplification and Minimalism Review

Run the Task code-simplicity-reviewer() to see if we can simplify the code.

### 5. Findings Synthesis and Todo Creation Using file-todos Skill

<critical_requirement> ALL findings MUST be stored in the todos/ directory using the file-todos skill. Create todo files immediately after synthesis - do NOT present findings for user approval first. Use the skill for structured todo management. </critical_requirement>

#### Step 1: Synthesize All Findings

<thinking>
Consolidate all agent reports into a categorized list of findings.
Remove duplicates, prioritize by severity and impact.
</thinking>

<synthesis_tasks>

- [ ] Collect findings from all parallel agents
- [ ] Categorize by type: security, performance, architecture, quality, etc.
- [ ] Assign severity levels: 🔴 CRITICAL (P1), 🟡 IMPORTANT (P2), 🔵 NICE-TO-HAVE (P3)
- [ ] Remove duplicate or overlapping findings
- [ ] Estimate effort for each finding (Small/Medium/Large)

</synthesis_tasks>

#### Step 2: Create Todo Files Using file-todos Skill

<critical_instruction> Use the file-todos skill to create todo files for ALL findings immediately. Do NOT present findings one-by-one asking for user approval. Create all todo files in parallel using the skill, then summarize results to user. </critical_instruction>

**Implementation Options:**

**Option A: Direct File Creation (Fast)**

- Create todo files directly using Write tool
- All findings in parallel for speed
- Use standard template from `.claude/skills/file-todos/assets/todo-template.md`
- Follow naming convention: `{issue_id}-pending-{priority}-{description}.md`

**Option B: Sub-Agents in Parallel (Recommended for Scale)** For large PRs with 15+ findings, use sub-agents to create finding files in parallel:

```bash
# Launch multiple finding-creator agents in parallel
Task() - Create todos for first finding
Task() - Create todos for second finding
Task() - Create todos for third finding
etc. for each finding.
```

Sub-agents can:

- Process multiple findings simultaneously
- Write detailed todo files with all sections filled
- Organize findings by severity
- Create comprehensive Proposed Solutions
- Add acceptance criteria and work logs
- Complete much faster than sequential processing

**Execution Strategy:**

1. Synthesize all findings into categories (P1/P2/P3)
2. Group findings by severity
3. Launch 3 parallel sub-agents (one per severity level)
4. Each sub-agent creates its batch of todos using the file-todos skill
5. Consolidate results and present summary

**Process (Using file-todos Skill):**

1. For each finding:

   - Determine severity (P1/P2/P3)
   - Write detailed Problem Statement and Findings
   - Create 2-3 Proposed Solutions with pros/cons/effort/risk
   - Estimate effort (Small/Medium/Large)
   - Add acceptance criteria and work log

2. Use file-todos skill for structured todo management:

   ```bash
   skill: file-todos
   ```

   The skill provides:

   - Template location: `.claude/skills/file-todos/assets/todo-template.md`
   - Naming convention: `{issue_id}-{status}-{priority}-{description}.md`
   - YAML frontmatter structure: status, priority, issue_id, tags, dependencies
   - All required sections: Problem Statement, Findings, Solutions, etc.

3. Create todo files in parallel:

   ```bash
   {next_id}-pending-{priority}-{description}.md
   ```

4. Examples:

   ```
   001-pending-p1-path-traversal-vulnerability.md
   002-pending-p1-api-response-validation.md
   003-pending-p2-concurrency-limit.md
   004-pending-p3-unused-parameter.md
   ```

5. Follow template structure from file-todos skill: `.claude/skills/file-todos/assets/todo-template.md`

**Todo File Structure (from template):**

Each todo must include:

- **YAML frontmatter**: status, priority, issue_id, tags, dependencies
- **Problem Statement**: What's broken/missing, why it matters
- **Findings**: Discoveries from agents with evidence/location
- **Proposed Solutions**: 2-3 options, each with pros/cons/effort/risk
- **Recommended Action**: (Filled during triage, leave blank initially)
- **Technical Details**: Affected files, components, database changes
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable checklist items
- **Work Log**: Dated record with actions and learnings
- **Resources**: Links to PR, issues, documentation, similar patterns

**File naming convention:**

```
{issue_id}-{status}-{priority}-{description}.md

Examples:
- 001-pending-p1-security-vulnerability.md
- 002-pending-p2-performance-optimization.md
- 003-pending-p3-code-cleanup.md
```

**Status values:**

- `pending` - New findings, needs triage/decision
- `ready` - Approved by manager, ready to work
- `complete` - Work finished

**Priority values:**

- `p1` - Critical (blocks merge, security/data issues)
- `p2` - Important (should fix, architectural/performance)
- `p3` - Nice-to-have (enhancements, cleanup)

**Tagging:** Always add `code-review` tag, plus: `security`, `performance`, `architecture`, `rails`, `quality`, etc.

#### Step 3: Summary Report

After creating all todo files, present comprehensive summary:

````markdown
## ✅ Code Review Complete

**Review Target:** PR #XXXX - [PR Title] **Branch:** [branch-name]

### Findings Summary:

- **Total Findings:** [X]
- **🔴 CRITICAL (P1):** [count] - BLOCKS MERGE
- **🟡 IMPORTANT (P2):** [count] - Should Fix
- **🔵 NICE-TO-HAVE (P3):** [count] - Enhancements

### Created Todo Files:

**P1 - Critical (BLOCKS MERGE):**

- `001-pending-p1-{finding}.md` - {description}
- `002-pending-p1-{finding}.md` - {description}

**P2 - Important:**

- `003-pending-p2-{finding}.md` - {description}
- `004-pending-p2-{finding}.md` - {description}

**P3 - Nice-to-Have:**

- `005-pending-p3-{finding}.md` - {description}

### Review Agents Used:

- kieran-rails-reviewer
- security-sentinel
- performance-oracle
- architecture-strategist
- agent-native-reviewer
- [other agents]

### Next Steps:

1. **Address P1 Findings**: CRITICAL - must be fixed before merge

   - Review each P1 todo in detail
   - Implement fixes or request exemption
   - Verify fixes before merging PR

2. **Triage All Todos**:
   ```bash
   ls todos/*-pending-*.md  # View all pending todos
   /triage                  # Use slash command for interactive triage
   ```
````

3. **Work on Approved Todos**:

   ```bash
   /resolve_todo_parallel  # Fix all approved items efficiently
   ```

4. **Track Progress**:
   - Rename file when status changes: pending → ready → complete
   - Update Work Log as you work
   - Commit todos: `git add todos/ && git commit -m "refactor: add code review findings"`

### Severity Breakdown:

**🔴 P1 (Critical - Blocks Merge):**

- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption risks
- Breaking changes
- Critical architectural issues

**🟡 P2 (Important - Should Fix):**

- Performance issues
- Significant architectural concerns
- Major code quality problems
- Reliability issues

**🔵 P3 (Nice-to-Have):**

- Minor improvements
- Code cleanup
- Optimization opportunities
- Documentation updates

```

### 7. End-to-End Testing (Optional)

<detect_project_type>

**First, detect the project type from PR files:**

| Indicator | Project Type |
|-----------|--------------|
| `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift` (iOS) | iOS/macOS |
| `Gemfile`, `package.json`, `app/views/*`, `*.html.*` | Web |
| Both iOS files AND web files | Hybrid (test both) |

</detect_project_type>

<offer_testing>

After presenting the Summary Report, offer appropriate testing based on project type:

**For Web Projects:**
```markdown
**"Want to run Playwright browser tests on the affected pages?"**
1. Yes - run `/playwright-test`
2. No - skip
```

**For iOS Projects:**
```markdown
**"Want to run Xcode simulator tests on the app?"**
1. Yes - run `/xcode-test`
2. No - skip
```

**For Hybrid Projects (e.g., Rails + Hotwire Native):**
```markdown
**"Want to run end-to-end tests?"**
1. Web only - run `/playwright-test`
2. iOS only - run `/xcode-test`
3. Both - run both commands
4. No - skip
```

</offer_testing>

#### If User Accepts Web Testing:

Spawn a subagent to run Playwright tests (preserves main context):

```
Task general-purpose("Run /playwright-test for PR #[number]. Test all affected pages, check for console errors, handle failures by creating todos and fixing.")
```

The subagent will:
1. Identify pages affected by the PR
2. Navigate to each page and capture snapshots
3. Check for console errors
4. Test critical interactions
5. Pause for human verification on OAuth/email/payment flows
6. Create P1 todos for any failures
7. Fix and retry until all tests pass

**Standalone:** `/playwright-test [PR number]`

#### If User Accepts iOS Testing:

Spawn a subagent to run Xcode tests (preserves main context):

```
Task general-purpose("Run /xcode-test for scheme [name]. Build for simulator, install, launch, take screenshots, check for crashes.")
```

The subagent will:
1. Verify XcodeBuildMCP is installed
2. Discover project and schemes
3. Build for iOS Simulator
4. Install and launch app
5. Take screenshots of key screens
6. Capture console logs for errors
7. Pause for human verification (Sign in with Apple, push, IAP)
8. Create P1 todos for any failures
9. Fix and retry until all tests pass

**Standalone:** `/xcode-test [scheme]`

### Important: P1 Findings Block Merge

Any **🔴 P1 (CRITICAL)** findings must be addressed before merging the PR. Present these prominently and ensure they're resolved before accepting the PR.
```

can you write a test - which should fail right now - for each P1 item showing that it's an issue?

---

let's implement a fix for both then

---

is shadowBranchHashLength now used everywhere?

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User ran `/workflows:review` command for PR #2 in the entireio/cli repository - a comprehensive code review workflow.

2. **PR Setup and Context**:
   - PR #2: "Move 'clean' root command to 'session cleanup', some refactoring"
   - Branch: `soph/move-clean-to-session-cleanup`
   - Changes: 825 additions, 221 deletions, 10 files changed
   - Key change: Moving `entire clean` to `entire session cleanup` and making cleanup strategy-owned

3. **Code Review Phase**:
   - I fetched PR metadata, checked out the PR branch
   - Read all changed files: cleanup.go, strategy/cleanup.go, auto_commit.go, manual_commit.go, strategy.go, cleanup_test.go
   - Launched 6 parallel review agents: architecture, pattern-recognition, security, performance, data-integrity, code-simplicity

4. **Review Findings Synthesis**:
   - Tests pass, linting passes
   - Identified 16 findings across categories
   - **2 Critical (P1)** findings identified:
     1. Active sessions could be deleted as orphaned (no grace period)
     2. Hash length mismatch: shadow branches use 7-char hashes but BaseCommit stores 40-char hashes

5. **User Request #1**: "can you write a test - which should fail right now - for each P1 item showing that it's an issue?"

6. **Test Writing**:
   - Added two failing tests to `cmd/entire/cli/strategy/clean_test.go`:
     - `TestListOrphanedSessionStates_RecentSessionNotOrphaned`
     - `TestListOrphanedSessionStates_HashLengthMismatch`
   - Both tests failed as expected, proving the bugs exist

7. **User Request #2**: "let's implement a fix for both then"

8. **Fix Implementation**:
   - Added constants and fixed `ListOrphanedSessionStates()` in `cleanup.go`
   - Added `sessionGracePeriod = 10 * time.Minute`
   - Added `shadowBranchHashLength = 7`
   - Fixed hash comparison to use prefix matching
   - Tests passed after fixes

9. **User Request #3**: "is shadowBranchHashLength now used everywhere?"

10. **Current Work**: 
    - Found 3 places with hardcoded `[:7]` for shadow branch naming
    - Added `ShadowBranchHashLength = 7` constant to `checkpoint/temporary.go`
    - Updated `ShadowBranchNameForCommit()` in `temporary.go`
    - Updated `getShadowBranchNameForCommit()` in `manual_commit_session.go`
    - Updated `auto_commit.go:963`
    - **Discovered inconsistency**: auto_commit stores BaseCommit as 7-char, manual_commit stores full 40-char hash
    - Was investigating this when summary was requested

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - User initiated a comprehensive code review workflow for PR #2 (`soph/move-clean-to-session-cleanup`) in the Entire CLI Go project
   - PR moves the `entire clean` command to `entire session cleanup` subcommand and refactors cleanup to be strategy-owned
   - After review identified 2 Critical (P1) bugs, user requested failing tests to demonstrate the issues
   - User then requested fixes for both P1 bugs
   - User asked if the new `shadowBranchHashLength` constant was used everywhere it should be

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Go CLI with Cobra commands
   - Strategy pattern with optional interfaces (`OrphanedItemsLister`)
   - Git shadow branches (`entire/<7-char-hash>`) for session checkpoints
   - Session state management in `.git/entire-sessions/`
   - Checkpoint metadata on `entire/sessions` branch
   - Hash length mismatch between shadow branch names (7-char) and `BaseCommit` storage (40-char in manual_commit, 7-char in auto_commit)

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **cmd/entire/cli/strategy/cleanup.go** - Main cleanup logic
     - Added constants and fixed `ListOrphanedSessionStates()`:
     ```go
     const (
         sessionGracePeriod = 10 * time.Minute
         shadowBranchHashLength = 7
     )
     
     // In ListOrphanedSessionStates():
     // Skip recent sessions
     if now.Sub(state.StartedAt) < sessionGracePeriod {
         continue
     }
     
     // Fix hash prefix matching
     hasShadowBranch := false
     if len(state.BaseCommit) >= shadowBranchHashLength {
         hasShadowBranch = shadowBranchSet[state.BaseCommit[:shadowBranchHashLength]]
     }
     ```

   - **cmd/entire/cli/strategy/clean_test.go** - Added two failing tests that now pass:
     - `TestListOrphanedSessionStates_RecentSessionNotOrphaned` - Tests grace period protection
     - `TestListOrphanedSessionStates_HashLengthMismatch` - Tests hash prefix matching

   - **cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint/temporary.go** - Added canonical constant:
     ```go
     const (
         ShadowBranchPrefix = "entire/"
         ShadowBranchHashLength = 7
         // ...
     )
     
     func ShadowBranchNameForCommit(baseCommit string) string {
         if len(baseCommit) >= ShadowBranchHashLength {
             return ShadowBranchPrefix + baseCommit[:ShadowBranchHashLength]
         }
         return ShadowBranchPrefix + baseCommit
     }
     ```

   - **cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_session.go** - Updated to use constant:
     ```go
     import "entire.io/cli/cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint"
     
     func getShadowBranchNameForCommit(baseCommit string) string {
         if len(baseCommit) >= checkpoint.ShadowBranchHashLength {
             return shadowBranchPrefix + baseCommit[:checkpoint.ShadowBranchHashLength]
         }
         return shadowBranchPrefix + baseCommit
     }
     ```

   - **cmd/entire/cli/strategy/auto_commit.go** - Updated line 963:
     ```go
     baseCommit := head.Hash().String()[:checkpoint.ShadowBranchHashLength]
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **P1 Bug #1 - Active session deletion**: Sessions just started (no checkpoints yet) were incorrectly marked as orphaned
     - Fix: Added 10-minute grace period check before marking sessions as orphaned
   - **P1 Bug #2 - Hash length mismatch**: Shadow branches use 7-char hashes but `state.BaseCommit` stored 40-char hashes, causing comparison to always fail
     - Fix: Use prefix matching `state.BaseCommit[:shadowBranchHashLength]` instead of full hash comparison
   - **Missing import**: Had to add `time` import to clean_test.go and `checkpoint` import to manual_commit_session.go

5. Problem Solving:
   - Comprehensive code review completed with 6 parallel agent analysis
   - Identified and documented 16 findings (2 P1, 7 P2, 7 P3)
   - Wrote failing tests to prove P1 bugs exist
   - Implemented fixes that made tests pass
   - Refactored hardcoded `[:7]` to use `ShadowBranchHashLength` constant
   - **Discovered inconsistency**: `auto_commit.go` stores `BaseCommit` as 7-char while `manual_commit_hooks.go` stores it as full 40-char hash

6. All user messages:
   - Initial `/workflows:review https://github.com/entireio/cli/pr/2` command
   - "can you write a test - which should fail right now - for each P1 item showing that it's an issue?"
   - "let's implement a fix for both then"
   - "is shadowBranchHashLength now used everywhere?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Need to verify all tests still pass after constant refactoring
   - Need to investigate/resolve the `BaseCommit` storage inconsistency between auto_commit (7-char) and manual_commit (40-char) strategies

8. Current Work:
   User asked "is shadowBranchHashLength now used everywhere?" and I was in the process of:
   - Added `ShadowBranchHashLength = 7` to `checkpoint/temporary.go`
   - Updated `ShadowBranchNameForCommit()` in `temporary.go`
   - Updated `getShadowBranchNameForCommit()` in `manual_commit_session.go` (added checkpoint import)
   - Updated `auto_commit.go:963` to use `checkpoint.ShadowBranchHashLength`
   - Discovered that auto_commit stores `BaseCommit` as 7-char but manual_commit stores full 40-char
   - Was investigating this inconsistency when summary was requested

9. Optional Next Step:
   Run tests to verify the constant refactoring doesn't break anything, then investigate the `BaseCommit` storage inconsistency between strategies. The user's question "is shadowBranchHashLength now used everywhere?" suggests ensuring consistency across the codebase is important. Need to determine if the auto_commit 7-char BaseCommit vs manual_commit 40-char BaseCommit is intentional or another bug..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
