Let's make some more changes to explain.
1. add a `--raw-transcript` option to the `entire explain -c {checkpoint-id}` command which just returns the raw transcript file
2. change `--full` to _replace_ the current scoped prompt section from `entire explain -c` to a parsed full transcript (does this make sense?), and don't append the raw transcript any more
