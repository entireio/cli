fix merge conflicts from parent please

do we need to fix up the downstream uses of LastInteractionAt?

complete the merge and push

while we're here, we have some other feedback:
GetTranscriptStart() falls through to TranscriptLinesAtStart when CheckpointTranscriptStart is 0. If both are 0, it correctly returns 0 (meaning "start from beginning"). However, the comment says "falls back to deprecated TranscriptLinesAtStart for old data" which could be misleading -- it also returns 0 for genuinely new checkpoints. Minor clarity issue only.SessionState = session.State and PromptAttribution = session.PromptAttribution are type aliases. This means the strategy package exposes session.State directly under a different name. If the intent is to eventually decouple them, a type definition (type SessionState session.State) would be better. If the intent is permanent unification, the alias is correct and the comment explains the history well.Ï[cmd/entire/cli/session/state.go:136-151] NormalizeAfterLoad clears deprecated fields on every load: After normalization, if the state is re-saved, the deprecated fields will be gone from the JSON. This means an older CLI version reading the same state file would see 0 for condensed_transcript_lines and transcript_lines_at_start, losing the transcript offset. This is a one-way migration. If a user downgrades their CLI version, sessions in progress could have incorrect transcript scoping.This is likely acceptable given the nature of the tool (CLI versions are expected to upgrade monotonically), but worth noting as a known trade-off

let's discuss

yep do it
