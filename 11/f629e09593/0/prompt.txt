can you review PR 284 and I think we already have code that checks if git commits are setup on each session, or?

---

I mean not git config but git hooks, can you validate: we have EnsureSetup which calls IsGitHookInstalled and I think this happens during each session so basically we have what the PR does, right?

---

For auto commit we only need the push hook, or?

---

ok, let's do this fix then, ignore the existing PR

---

commit this

---

[Request interrupted by user]

---

Question: For manual strategy we assumed the user commits after a prompt is done, what now is a common pattern also is to say the agent "do this change, and then make a commit" so the commit happens before stop. This means if we do EnsureSetup in stop we might be to late. Is there a good reason not to move EnsureSetup forward to the first hook that is called in a session?

---

yes

---

what other things does EnsureSetup do?

---

do we have test coverage for this?

---

yes please do

---

In EnsureSetup(), the error from InstallGitHook(true) is returned without context, while other failures in this method are wrapped (e.g., open repo / ensure metadata branch). Wrapping this error (e.g., "failed to install git hooks") would make failures easier to diagnose and keep error reporting consistent within the function.

---

This test duplicates the hook marker string and the list of hook names from strategy/hooks.go. That makes the test brittle (a future change to the marker or managed hooks will require updating tests in two places). Consider exposing these via a small exported helper in the strategy package (e.g., marker getter / managed hook list, or a function that validates hooks for a given git dir) so tests can reference the single source of truth without relying on os.Chdir().
