# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

how does this work with auto-commit?

### Prompt 2

Yeah I think we need this, like the trailer on the real commit should match exactly one commit in entire/sessions

1. **Initial Issue (Gemini agent hooks firing but no shadow branch created)**

   - Test repo: `/Users/soph/Work/entire/test/gemini_test`
   - I investigated logs in `.entire/logs` ...

### Prompt 4

do we have added test coverage for the new logic?
