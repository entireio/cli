on which data does "entire session list" operates?

---

what value is shown in the last column of session list?

---

Could we show the commit message instead? Like there should always be a commit matching the session, for auto-commit this is then usually also the prompt but for manual-commit it might be a more descriptive thing

---

Option 1 doesn't work since the commit hash can change, that's why we add the "Entire-Checkpoint" trailer to the real commits. Since that is the stable link. I wonder now if we should add this to CLAUDE.md somehow so you remember this?

---

In theory the commits we look at should have either nearly the same date or a newer date then the commit date the commit in entire/sessions has.

---

you wrote: So we can use the checkpoint's CreatedAt timestamp as an upper bound and search backwards from there. 
what does upper bound means here? just to be sure, the date of the commit in entire/sessions never change but a user could rebase/ammend a commit containing the actual change so it is then newer then the commit in entire/sessions. I mostly meant it's not worth looking more then a few minutes older then the commit in entire/sessions but then up to now. Does this make sense?

---

yes, exactly, please implement this.

---

looking at this now I can see for example:  2026-01-06-cf564e14  1            can you add a standard MIT license?
this is currently an unmerged PR, so going down the commit list isn't working here. I wonder if we could include the branch in `entire/sessions` metadata commits, so we have a hint where to look?

---

can we also show the branch name in `entire session list` ?

---

thinking about "Refactored findCommitMessageByCheckpointID() to search the branch hint first" if I worked on the branch locally, created a PR and then merged it. I would not care about the branch anymore but more that the commit/session is merged into the default branch. So wondering if we should rather fallback to the branch. And then session list could also show that a session belongs to a merged commit?

---

option 3

---

can we make it a bit wider?

---

the issue is now of course that we haven't checked out the remote branches, so the cli can't find them...
