when using the cli I just noticed an issue that two manual commits after each other had the same checkpoint id, can you check how this can happen, this shouldn't be a thing, right?

---

yes

---

is it worth to add new tests for this? that make the intent clear? or would it be testing something that shouldn't be there

---

yeah let's check existing tests, I hope there isn't one since it should have failed but we should definetly have one testing the scenario and making sure it's fixed
