can you check: what would happen on rewind for a gemini checkpoint, would we run the right code with the right logs to the right place or is this still claude centric?

---

yeah let's do the fix for 1 first

---

ok, let's fix the ending next, what would you propose?

---

yes, let's do that

---

now handle: 

  2. .gemini/ directory not protected during rewind (MEDIUM)

  common.go:191 defines only claudeDir = ".claude" for skip/protect lists. During rewind file deletion, .gemini/ (which may contain settings.json) is not protected and could be deleted if it wasn't present at checkpoint time.

---

3. .gemini/ not skipped in collectUntrackedFiles() (LOW)

  Gemini's config directory would get collected as untracked files at session start - benign but unnecessary.

---

how much effort would it be to call the agents for any protected paths they care about? so we don't need to update isProtectedPath everytime a new agent is added?

---

Yeah let's do this

---

can we add some simple tests?

---

can you review the changes in the branch now once more as a whole

---

Task checkpoint transcript writes JSONL to Gemini JSON file

Medium Severity

restoreTaskCheckpointTranscript uses parseTranscriptFromBytes and writeTranscript, which are hardcoded to Claude's JSONL format. For Gemini (whose transcripts are JSON objects with a messages array), parseTranscriptFromBytes silently drops most lines, and writeTranscript writes JSONL content. The file is now correctly named .json via agent.SessionFileExtension(), but the content is still JSONL — producing a corrupt file that Gemini CLI would find but fail to parse.

---

AllProtectedDirs() holds registryMu.RLock() while invoking factory() and Agent.ProtectedDirs(). Calling external code while holding the registry lock risks deadlocks and makes the registry lock a potential bottleneck if future factories do more work. Consider copying the factories (or instantiated agents) under the lock, releasing the lock, then collecting/deduping ProtectedDirs outside the critical section.

---

isProtectedPath() checks prefixes using "dir + '/'". relPath comes from filepath.Rel/Walk and will use OS-specific separators (e.g., "\" on Windows), so this can fail to detect protected paths on non-Unix platforms. Consider normalizing relPath/dir with filepath.ToSlash (or using string(filepath.Separator) consistently) before prefix checks.

---

ok, I tested the whole changes in this branch now in /Users/soph/Work/entire/test/test-multi

And this happened:

Writing transcript to: /Users/soph/.gemini/tmp/-Users-soph-Work-entire-test-test-multi/chats/a89c-e7804df731b8.json
Rewound to 2fdc255. gemini --resume a89c-e7804df731b8

when I then used the proposed resume command:

❯ gemini --resume a89c-e7804df731b8
Loaded cached credentials.
Detected terminal background color: #282c34
Detected terminal name: ghostty 1.2.3
Error resuming session: Invalid session identifier "a89c-e7804df731b8".
  Use --list-sessions to see available sessions, then use --resume {number}, --resume {uuid}, or --resume latest.%

If I do list-sessions:

❯ gemini --list-sessions

Available sessions for this project (3):
  1. End the conversation. (5 hours ago) [3cccf60d-0f46-4620-92ee-7806ea541bbd]
  2. Generate a Ruby script for random colored letters. (2 hours ago) [38df70dd-4a58-4e7e-a501-d7f56b90ac71]
  3. Generate a Ruby script for random colored letters. (Just now) [0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8]

So somehow the format of the session id is wrong

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial request**: User asked to check if rewind would work correctly for Gemini checkpoints or if it's Claude-centric.

2. **Exploration phase**: I launched an Explore agent that thoroughly analyzed the rewind flow and identified 3 issues:
   - HIGH: `RestoreLogsOnly()` hardcoded to Claude's project directory
   - MEDIUM: `.gemini/` not protected during rewind file deletion
   - LOW: `.gemini/` not skipped in `collectUntrackedFiles()`

3. **Fix 1 - RestoreLogsOnly agent-aware** (user said "yeah let's do the fix for 1 first"):
   - Added `resolveAgentForRewind()` helper that falls back to default agent (Claude) for empty agent type
   - Changed `paths.GetClaudeProjectDir(repoRoot)` → `ag.GetSessionDir(repoRoot)`
   - Changed `sessionid.ModelSessionID(sessionID)` → `ag.ExtractAgentSessionID(sessionID)`
   - Updated `classifySessionsForRestore` to accept agent parameter
   - Renamed variables from Claude-specific to generic names
   - Updated `LogsOnlyRestorer` interface comment
   - Lint fixes: added `//nolint:ireturn` and wrapped error from `agent.GetByAgentType`

4. **Fix 2 - SessionFileExtension** (user said "yes, let's do that"):
   - Added `SessionFileExtension() string` to Agent interface
   - Claude returns `.jsonl`, Gemini returns `.json`
   - Updated 5 callsites across `rewind.go` (3) and `manual_commit_rewind.go` (2)

5. **Fix 3 - Protected directories** (user said "Yeah let's do this" to both the fix and making it dynamic):
   - Replaced `claudeDir = ".claude"` constant with `protectedDirs()` function + `isProtectedPath()` helper
   - Added `ProtectedDirs() []string` to Agent interface
   - Added `AllProtectedDirs()` to registry that collects from all agents
   - Claude returns `[".claude"]`, Gemini returns `[".gemini"]`
   - Replaced all 3 inline protection checks with `isProtectedPath()`

6. **Tests** (user said "can we add some simple tests"):
   - `TestAllProtectedDirs` in registry_test.go (3 subtests)
   - `TestSessionFileExtension` and `TestProtectedDirs` for both Claude and Gemini
   - `TestIsProtectedPath` with 12 cases in common_test.go
   - `TestResolveAgentForRewind` with 4 subtests in rewind_test.go
   - Fixed goconst lint by using agent constants instead of string literals

7. **Review** (user said "can you review the changes in the branch now once more as a whole"):
   - Launched reviewer agent
   - Critical finding: `resolveAgentForRewind` didn't handle `AgentTypeUnknown` ("Agent") - old checkpoints would error
   - Fixed by using `!isSpecificAgentType(agentType)` instead of `agentType == ""`
   - Added test for "Agent" type fallback
   - Fixed stale Claude-centric comments in rewind.go and common.go
   - Added `sync.Once` caching for `protectedDirs()`

8. **Task checkpoint transcript issue** (user flagged from review):
   - `restoreTaskCheckpointTranscript` uses JSONL-only pipeline
   - Determined this is unreachable for Gemini (only Claude creates task checkpoints)
   - Added documentation comment noting the limitation

9. **Registry lock fix** (user flagged):
   - `AllProtectedDirs()` was holding RLock while calling factory() and ProtectedDirs()
   - Fixed by copying factories under lock, releasing, then iterating

10. **filepath.Separator fix** (user flagged):
    - `isProtectedPath` used hardcoded "/" which fails on Windows
    - Fixed by using `string(filepath.Separator)`
    - Also restored a `//nolint:goconst` comment that a linter had removed

11. **Current issue** (user's latest message): User tested the changes and found that Gemini resume command doesn't work. The session ID format is wrong:
    - Written: `a89c-e7804df731b8.json` (truncated)
    - Full UUID: `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`
    - Resume command: `gemini --resume a89c-e7804df731b8` (fails)
    - Gemini expects the full UUID: `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`

The issue is in `ExtractAgentSessionID` / `sessionid.ModelSessionID()` which strips a date prefix from Entire session IDs. The Entire session ID format is like `2026-01-13-0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`, and `ModelSessionID` strips the date prefix `2026-01-13-`, leaving `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`. But looking at the output, only `a89c-e7804df731b8` was used - which suggests the stripping is too aggressive, removing more than just the date prefix. Or the Entire session ID has a different format for Gemini.

The file path written was `a89c-e7804df731b8.json` but the full Gemini session UUID is `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`. The resume command also used `a89c-e7804df731b8`. So `ExtractAgentSessionID` / `ModelSessionID` is stripping too much.

Looking at the session ID format: Gemini's ID is `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`. The Entire format prepends a date: `2026-02-10-0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`. The `ModelSessionID` function strips the `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix (11 chars). But if the function uses a regex or split on `-`, it might be splitting on all dashes up to a certain point, which would over-strip the UUID.

This is the bug the user wants investigated/fixed next.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user asked to audit and fix the rewind functionality in the Entire CLI to be agent-agnostic rather than hardcoded to Claude. The work involved making `RestoreLogsOnly()` write to the correct agent's session directory, using agent-specific file extensions (`.jsonl` vs `.json`), protecting agent config directories (`.gemini/`) during rewind, and making the protection list dynamic based on registered agents. After implementation, the user tested the full flow and discovered a bug: Gemini session IDs are being truncated during rewind, causing `gemini --resume` to fail.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Agent interface pattern (`agent.Agent`) with registry for Claude Code and Gemini CLI
   - Strategy pattern for session management (`ManualCommitStrategy`, `AutoCommitStrategy`)
   - Rewind flow: file restoration from shadow branches + transcript restoration to agent session directories
   - Logs-only rewind: restores transcripts from `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch without modifying working directory
   - Session ID transformation: Entire wraps agent session IDs with date prefixes (`2026-02-10-<uuid>`)
   - `sessionid.ModelSessionID()` strips the date prefix to recover the original agent session ID
   - Protected directories during `filepath.Walk` in rewind operations
   - `sync.Once` caching for performance on hot paths
   - OS-portable path separator handling

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/agent.go`**
     - Core Agent interface - added two new methods
     ```go
     ProtectedDirs() []string
     SessionFileExtension() string
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/registry.go`**
     - Added `AllProtectedDirs()` that copies factories under lock, releases lock, then collects dirs
     ```go
     func AllProtectedDirs() []string {
         registryMu.RLock()
         factories := make([]Factory, 0, len(registry))
         for _, f := range registry {
             factories = append(factories, f)
         }
         registryMu.RUnlock()
         // ... dedup and sort outside lock
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/claudecode/claude.go`**
     - Returns `.jsonl` for extension, `[".claude"]` for protected dirs

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/geminicli/gemini.go`**
     - Returns `.json` for extension, `[".gemini"]` for protected dirs
     - `GetSessionDir` returns `~/.gemini/tmp/<hash>/chats/`
     - `ExtractAgentSessionID` calls `sessionid.ModelSessionID(entireSessionID)`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_rewind.go`**
     - Major refactor of `RestoreLogsOnly()`: resolves agent from `point.Agent`, uses `ag.GetSessionDir()`, `ag.ExtractAgentSessionID()`, `ag.SessionFileExtension()`
     - `classifySessionsForRestore` now takes `sessionDir string, ag agent.Agent` instead of `claudeProjectDir string`
     - Added `resolveAgentForRewind()` with `!isSpecificAgentType(agentType)` fallback for old checkpoints

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/common.go`**
     - Removed `claudeDir = ".claude"` constant
     - Added `isProtectedPath()` using `string(filepath.Separator)` for OS portability
     - Added `protectedDirs()` with `sync.Once` caching combining static dirs + `agent.AllProtectedDirs()`
     - All 3 inline protection checks replaced with `isProtectedPath()`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/rewind.go`**
     - 3 callsites updated from `.jsonl` to `agent.SessionFileExtension()`
     - Claude-centric comments updated to agent-agnostic
     - Added NOTE comment on `restoreTaskCheckpointTranscript` about JSONL-only pipeline

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/strategy.go`**
     - Updated `LogsOnlyRestorer` interface comment

   - **Test files**: `registry_test.go`, `claudecode/claude_test.go`, `geminicli/gemini_test.go`, `common_test.go`, `rewind_test.go` - all with new test cases

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **ireturn lint**: `resolveAgentForRewind` returns interface → added `//nolint:ireturn`
   - **wrapcheck lint**: bare return from `agent.GetByAgentType` → wrapped with `fmt.Errorf`
   - **goconst lint**: `"claude-code"` repeated in tests → used `agent.AgentNameClaudeCode` constant
   - **AgentTypeUnknown backward compatibility** (from review): old checkpoints store `"Agent"` as agent type, which would fail `GetByAgentType` lookup → fixed by using `!isSpecificAgentType()` instead of `== ""`
   - **Registry lock holding** (user feedback): `AllProtectedDirs` held RLock during factory calls → fixed by copying factories under lock, releasing, then iterating
   - **Windows path separator** (user feedback): `isProtectedPath` used hardcoded `"/"` → fixed with `string(filepath.Separator)`
   - **Linter removed nolint comment**: `manual_commit_test.go` had `//nolint:goconst` stripped by formatter → restored it

5. Problem Solving:
   - Systematically identified all Claude-centric code in the rewind flow
   - Used the existing Agent interface pattern consistently (GetSessionDir, ExtractAgentSessionID)
   - Handled backward compatibility for old checkpoints without agent metadata
   - Made protected dirs dynamic so new agents get protection automatically
   - Identified task checkpoint transcript pipeline as JSONL-only but correctly scoped it as unreachable for Gemini
   - **Current unsolved bug**: Gemini session ID truncation during rewind - `ExtractAgentSessionID`/`ModelSessionID` appears to over-strip the session ID

6. All user messages:
   - "can you check: what would happen on rewind for a gemini checkpoint, would we run the right code with the right logs to the right place or is this still claude centric?"
   - "yeah let's do the fix for 1 first"
   - "ok, let's fix the ending next, what would you propose?"
   - "yes, let's do that"
   - "now handle: 2. .gemini/ directory not protected during rewind (MEDIUM)"
   - "3. .gemini/ not skipped in collectUntrackedFiles() (LOW)"
   - "how much effort would it be to call the agents for any protected paths they care about? so we don't need to update isProtectedPath everytime a new agent is added?"
   - "Yeah let's do this"
   - "can we add some simple tests?"
   - "can you review the changes in the branch now once more as a whole"
   - "ok, let's fix the ending next, what would you propose?" [about file extension]
   - "Task checkpoint transcript writes JSONL to Gemini JSON file" [flagging review finding]
   - "AllProtectedDirs() holds registryMu.RLock() while invoking factory()..." [flagging lock issue]
   - "isProtectedPath() checks prefixes using dir + '/'..." [flagging Windows issue]
   - Final message: User tested in `/Users/soph/Work/entire/test/test-multi` and found Gemini resume fails because session ID is truncated: file written as `a89c-e7804df731b8.json` but full Gemini UUID is `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix the Gemini session ID truncation bug: `ExtractAgentSessionID` (which calls `sessionid.ModelSessionID`) is stripping too much from the Entire session ID, producing `a89c-e7804df731b8` instead of the full UUID `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`

8. Current Work:
   The user tested the complete branch changes against a real Gemini session in `/Users/soph/Work/entire/test/test-multi` and found a bug. The rewind writes the transcript to the correct directory (`~/.gemini/tmp/.../chats/`) with the correct extension (`.json`), but the session ID is wrong. The file is named `a89c-e7804df731b8.json` instead of `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8.json`. The resume command `gemini --resume a89c-e7804df731b8` fails because Gemini expects the full UUID. The Gemini session list shows the full UUID is `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`.

   The bug is in the session ID extraction pipeline. Both `GeminiCLIAgent.ExtractAgentSessionID` and `ClaudeCodeAgent.ExtractAgentSessionID` call `sessionid.ModelSessionID()`. This function strips the date prefix from Entire session IDs (format: `YYYY-MM-DD-<agent-session-id>`). But for Gemini UUIDs which contain hyphens (e.g., `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`), the stripping logic appears to be too aggressive, removing parts of the UUID itself.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Investigate `sessionid.ModelSessionID()` in `cmd/entire/cli/sessionid/` to understand how it strips the date prefix and why it over-strips Gemini UUIDs. The function likely splits on `-` or uses a fixed character count that works for Claude session IDs but fails for standard UUIDs. The fix may need to be in `GeminiCLIAgent.ExtractAgentSessionID` to use Gemini-specific logic rather than sharing the same function as Claude.

   User's exact words: "when I then used the proposed resume command: `gemini --resume a89c-e7804df731b8` ... Error resuming session: Invalid session identifier" and showed that the full UUID should be `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/soph/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

---

is this session id handling wrong in other places or was just there?

---

ok, the id handling worked now, the resume command worked to but it then had the whole session (including the state I rewind past to) so not sure the file was copied to the right place or if we copied the wrong file (or checkpoint had full log)

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation, which is a continuation of a previous session that ran out of context.

**Previous Session Summary (from context):**
The user asked to audit and fix the rewind functionality to be agent-agnostic rather than Claude-centric. Multiple fixes were made:
1. `RestoreLogsOnly()` made agent-aware with `resolveAgentForRewind()` 
2. `SessionFileExtension()` added to Agent interface
3. Protected directories made dynamic via `ProtectedDirs()` and `AllProtectedDirs()`
4. Various tests added
5. Code review fixes: `AgentTypeUnknown` handling, `sync.Once` caching, `filepath.Separator` fix
6. Final issue: Gemini session ID truncation during rewind

**Current Session Messages:**

1. **User's continuation request (implicit):** Continue fixing the Gemini session ID truncation bug where the session ID `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8` was being truncated to `a89c-e7804df731b8`.

2. I investigated `sessionid.ModelSessionID()` - it has proper guards checking positions 4, 7, 10 for hyphens. For a UUID starting with `0544a0f5`, position 4 is 'a' not '-', so it returns as-is. The function is correct.

3. I traced the session ID flow through the entire system:
   - Hook input → `InitializeSession` → session state → condensation → checkpoint metadata → rewind
   - Found the session state file at `.git/entire-sessions/0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8.json` with the correct full UUID
   - Shadow branch commits have correct `Entire-Session: 0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8` trailers

4. **Found the bug:** `extractSessionIDFromMetadata()` in `rewind.go` at line 645:
   ```go
   parts := strings.SplitN(base, "-", 4)
   if len(parts) >= 4 {
       return parts[3]
   }
   ```
   For UUID `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`, SplitN gives `["0544a0f5", "46a6", "41b3", "a89c-e7804df731b8"]`, returning `parts[3]` = `"a89c-e7804df731b8"` (truncated!)

5. **Fix applied:**
   - Changed `extractSessionIDFromMetadata` to simply return `filepath.Base(metadataDir)` 
   - Updated both call sites (lines 291 and 488) to prefer `selectedPoint.SessionID` from the trailer
   - Added `rewind_test.go` with tests
   - All tests and lint pass

6. **User message:** "is this session id handling wrong in other places or was just there?"

7. I searched the codebase for similar patterns (`SplitN("-"`, date-prefix stripping, etc.) and confirmed it was only in that one place. The centralized `sessionid.ModelSessionID()` has proper guards.

8. **User message:** "ok, the id handling worked now, the resume command worked to but it then had the whole session (including the state I rewind past to) so not sure the file was copied to the right place or if we copied the wrong file (or checkpoint had full log)"

9. I investigated the transcript restoration:
   - Shadow branch has correctly scoped transcripts: 9KB at checkpoint 1, 18KB at checkpoint 2
   - Live Gemini file: 18,780 bytes
   - **Found the second bug:** The rewind writes to `<uuid>.json` but Gemini's actual file is `session-<date>-<shortid>.json` (different naming convention!)
   - Gemini's transcript_path: `session-2026-02-10T09-19-0544a0f5.json`
   - We construct: `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8.json`
   - Gemini's `--resume` reads from its OWN file, which is untouched

10. Started implementing fix:
    - Added `ResolveSessionFile(sessionDir, agentSessionID string) string` to Agent interface
    - Implemented for Claude: `filepath.Join(sessionDir, agentSessionID+".jsonl")`
    - Was about to implement for Gemini (search for existing `session-*-<id[:8]>.json`) when summary was requested

**Files modified in this session:**
- `cmd/entire/cli/rewind.go` - Fixed `extractSessionIDFromMetadata`, updated call sites
- `cmd/entire/cli/rewind_test.go` - New test file
- `cmd/entire/cli/agent/agent.go` - Added `ResolveSessionFile` to interface
- `cmd/entire/cli/agent/claudecode/claude.go` - Implemented `ResolveSessionFile`

**Still pending:**
- Implement `ResolveSessionFile` for Gemini (search for existing file by short ID pattern)
- Update `writeTranscriptToAgentSession` and other callers to use `ResolveSessionFile` instead of constructing path manually
- Update mock agent in tests
- Ensure the file is written to Gemini's actual transcript path

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user is continuing work on making the Entire CLI's rewind functionality agent-agnostic (supporting both Claude Code and Gemini CLI). In the previous session, multiple fixes were made (RestoreLogsOnly agent-aware, SessionFileExtension, ProtectedDirs, etc.). This session focused on two bugs discovered during real testing with Gemini:
   
   **Bug 1 (FIXED):** Gemini session ID truncation - `extractSessionIDFromMetadata()` in `rewind.go` incorrectly split UUIDs on hyphens, producing `a89c-e7804df731b8` instead of the full `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`.
   
   **Bug 2 (IN PROGRESS):** Transcript written to wrong file - the rewind writes to `<uuid>.json` but Gemini names files `session-<date>-<shortid>.json`. Gemini's `--resume` reads its own file (untouched, full transcript), so the user gets the complete session instead of the truncated-at-checkpoint version.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Agent interface pattern with `ResolveSessionFile` for agent-specific file naming
   - Shadow branch checkpoint storage: each commit captures transcript at that moment (correctly scoped - 9KB vs 18KB)
   - Gemini transcript naming: `session-<date>T<time>-<first8charsOfUUID>.json` (e.g., `session-2026-02-10T09-19-0544a0f5.json`)
   - Claude transcript naming: `<uuid>.jsonl` (matches simple `<id><ext>` construction)
   - `sessionid.ModelSessionID()` properly handles date-prefix stripping with position checks (`[4]=='-' && [7]=='-' && [10]=='-'`)
   - `extractSessionIDFromMetadata()` was the ONLY place with buggy `SplitN("-", 4)` pattern; all other code uses `ModelSessionID()`

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/rewind.go`** - Main rewind command implementation
     - Fixed `extractSessionIDFromMetadata` (was the root cause of Bug 1)
     - Updated two call sites to prefer `selectedPoint.SessionID` from trailer
     - Contains `writeTranscriptToAgentSession` which constructs wrong filename for Gemini (Bug 2)
     
     Fixed function:
     ```go
     func extractSessionIDFromMetadata(metadataDir string) string {
         // The metadata directory name IS the Entire session ID.
         // For new format: .entire/metadata/<agent-session-id> (e.g., UUID)
         // For legacy format: .entire/metadata/<date-prefixed-id>
         // Date-prefix stripping (for legacy IDs) is handled downstream by
         // ExtractAgentSessionID/ModelSessionID, so we return the full name here.
         return filepath.Base(metadataDir)
     }
     ```
     
     Updated call sites (both identical pattern):
     ```go
     } else {
         // Prefer SessionID from trailer over path-based extraction
         sessionID = selectedPoint.SessionID
         if sessionID == "" {
             sessionID = extractSessionIDFromMetadata(selectedPoint.MetadataDir)
         }
         transcriptFile = filepath.Join(selectedPoint.MetadataDir, paths.TranscriptFileNameLegacy)
     }
     ```
     
     Current broken code in `writeTranscriptToAgentSession` (Bug 2, line 752-753):
     ```go
     agentSessionID := agent.ExtractAgentSessionID(sessionID)
     sessionFile := filepath.Join(agentSessionDir, agentSessionID+agent.SessionFileExtension())
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/rewind_test.go`** - New test file for `extractSessionIDFromMetadata`
     ```go
     func TestExtractSessionIDFromMetadata(t *testing.T) {
         t.Parallel()
         tests := []struct {
             name        string
             metadataDir string
             expected    string
         }{
             {name: "UUID session ID", metadataDir: ".entire/metadata/0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8", expected: "0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8"},
             {name: "another UUID session ID", metadataDir: ".entire/metadata/f736da47-b2ca-4f86-bb32-a1bbe582e464", expected: "f736da47-b2ca-4f86-bb32-a1bbe582e464"},
             {name: "legacy date-prefixed session ID", metadataDir: ".entire/metadata/2026-01-25-f736da47-b2ca-4f86-bb32-a1bbe582e464", expected: "2026-01-25-f736da47-b2ca-4f86-bb32-a1bbe582e464"},
             // ... more test cases for legacy, auto-commit, simple IDs
         }
         // ... test runner
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/agent.go`** - Agent interface definition
     - Added `ResolveSessionFile` method to interface (in progress):
     ```go
     // ResolveSessionFile returns the path to the session transcript file for a given
     // agent session ID. Agents use different naming conventions:
     //   Claude: <sessionDir>/<id>.jsonl
     //   Gemini: <sessionDir>/session-<date>-<shortid>.json (searches for existing file)
     // If no existing file is found, returns a sensible default path.
     ResolveSessionFile(sessionDir, agentSessionID string) string
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/claudecode/claude.go`** - Claude agent implementation
     - Added `ResolveSessionFile` implementation:
     ```go
     // ResolveSessionFile returns the path to a Claude session file.
     // Claude names files directly as <id>.jsonl.
     func (c *ClaudeCodeAgent) ResolveSessionFile(sessionDir, agentSessionID string) string {
         return filepath.Join(sessionDir, agentSessionID+".jsonl")
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/geminicli/gemini.go`** - Gemini agent implementation
     - `ResolveSessionFile` NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (needs to search for `session-*-<id[:8]>.json`)
     - Session state shows transcript_path: `/Users/soph/.gemini/tmp/.../chats/session-2026-02-10T09-19-0544a0f5.json`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/sessionid/sessionid.go`** - Session ID transformation (verified correct)
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_rewind.go`** - Strategy rewind (RestoreLogsOnly also uses the same pattern, already fixed in previous session)
   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_condensation.go`** - Condensation stores `state.SessionID` correctly

   - **Test data examined:**
     - `.git/entire-sessions/0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8.json` - Session state with correct full UUID
     - Shadow branch `entire/af1b86b-e3b0c4` with 2 commits, trailers showing correct session ID
     - Checkpoint 1 transcript: 9,016 bytes; Checkpoint 2: 18,053 bytes; Live file: 18,780 bytes
     - Gemini chats dir has files: `session-2026-02-10T09-19-0544a0f5.json` (Gemini's naming)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Bug 1 - Session ID truncation (`extractSessionIDFromMetadata`):**
     - Root cause: `strings.SplitN(base, "-", 4)` treated first 3 UUID segments as a date prefix
     - For `0544a0f5-46a6-41b3-a89c-e7804df731b8`, split gives `["0544a0f5", "46a6", "41b3", "a89c-e7804df731b8"]`, returning truncated `"a89c-e7804df731b8"`
     - Fix: Return `filepath.Base(metadataDir)` directly; date-prefix stripping handled downstream by `ModelSessionID`
     - Also updated call sites to prefer `selectedPoint.SessionID` (from `Entire-Session` trailer) as primary source
     - Confirmed this was the ONLY place with this buggy pattern (searched entire codebase)
   
   - **Bug 2 - Wrong transcript file path (IN PROGRESS):**
     - Root cause: `writeTranscriptToAgentSession` constructs `<uuid>.json` but Gemini uses `session-<date>-<shortid>.json`
     - The truncated transcript is written to a file Gemini never reads
     - Gemini's `--resume` reads its own untouched file with the full session
     - Fix in progress: Adding `ResolveSessionFile` to Agent interface

5. Problem Solving:
   - Traced session ID flow through the entire pipeline (hook → state → condensation → metadata → rewind) to find Bug 1
   - Verified `sessionid.ModelSessionID()` is correct for both UUID and legacy date-prefixed formats
   - Used actual test data in `/Users/soph/Work/entire/test/test-multi` to verify shadow branch transcript sizes are correctly scoped
   - Confirmed Gemini's file naming convention by examining `~/.gemini/tmp/.../chats/` directory

6. All user messages:
   - (Initial continuation from previous session - implicit request to fix the Gemini session ID truncation bug)
   - "is this session id handling wrong in other places or was just there?"
   - "ok, the id handling worked now, the resume command worked to but it then had the whole session (including the state I rewind past to) so not sure the file was copied to the right place or if we copied the wrong file (or checkpoint had full log)"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Implement `ResolveSessionFile` for Gemini agent (search for existing `session-*-<id[:8]>.json` file)
   - Update all callers of the file path construction pattern to use `ResolveSessionFile`:
     - `writeTranscriptToAgentSession` in `rewind.go` (line 752-753)
     - `restoreSessionTranscript` in `rewind.go` (line 673-674) 
     - `restoreTaskCheckpointTranscript` in `rewind.go` (line 801-802)
     - `RestoreLogsOnly` callsites in `manual_commit_rewind.go` (lines 711-712, 828-829)
   - Update mock agent in tests to implement `ResolveSessionFile`
   - Verify build compiles and all tests pass

8. Current Work:
   I was in the middle of implementing the `ResolveSessionFile` method to fix Bug 2 (transcript written to wrong file for Gemini). I had:
   - Added `ResolveSessionFile(sessionDir, agentSessionID string) string` to the `Agent` interface in `agent.go`
   - Implemented it for Claude in `claudecode/claude.go` (simple: `filepath.Join(sessionDir, agentSessionID+".jsonl")`)
   - Was about to implement it for Gemini in `geminicli/gemini.go` (needs to search for existing `session-*-<id[:8]>.json` files)
   - Then need to update all callers to use `agent.ResolveSessionFile()` instead of manually constructing `agentSessionID + agent.SessionFileExtension()`

   The build currently FAILS because Gemini agent doesn't implement `ResolveSessionFile` yet.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Implement `ResolveSessionFile` for Gemini agent. The user said: "the resume command worked to but it then had the whole session (including the state I rewind past to)" - this is the bug being actively fixed. The Gemini implementation needs to search the session directory for an existing file matching `session-*-<first8chars>.json`, and if found return that path, otherwise fall back to `<dir>/<id>.json`. Then update all callers of the `agentSessionID + agent.SessionFileExtension()` pattern to use `agent.ResolveSessionFile(sessionDir, agentSessionID)`.
