I got an review for cmd/entire/cli/strategy/auto_commit.go 222-228: There's a logic issue here. The function always returns Created: true at line 228, even when commitOrHead returns HEAD hash without creating a new commit (when git.ErrEmptyCommit occurs). This can happen when files are staged but there are no actual changes to commit.

The function should track whether commitOrHead actually created a new commit. One approach is to compare the returned commit hash with the current HEAD hash before calling commitOrHead. If they're the same, no new commit was created and Created should be false.
