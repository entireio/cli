# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

have a look at linear https://linear.app/entirehq/issue/ENT-212/entire-explain-improvements - let's discuss

### Prompt 2

1. there should be a user associated with the _checkpoint metadata_ commit into `entire/sessions` - it's not in the metadata itself I don't believe. Is this easily available to us when we look up the checkpoints? This should also be the same user creating the code-side git commit...
2. yes, entire explain --commit <commit-sha> should return the checkpoint that commit is related to - or if there is no trailer it should say "No associated 
Entire checkpoint"
3. not sure what the current behaviour ...

### Prompt 3

1. is the cli-runner not the same as the session creator? :| How about pulling it out of the entire/sessions commit for now? I agree that adding it to the metadata.json longer term is better -> let's create a new linear issue for this to handle later
2. change the --commit behaviour; and it's related to 4. where the same view would be shown.
3. yes - I'd like it to show the same list view but filtered to a specific agent session

### Prompt 4

1. The same thing as in the git header: "Author: Alex Ong <alex@entire.io>" is fine
2. hmm, this is tricky, and rewrites of history break any reverse pointers we might try to build...do we do something similar to the branch filtering we do for the list view? (and reuse the code where possible) - also think about the performance impacts

### Prompt 5

we can't guarantee a list call prior to a detail call (though it will probably happen most of the time)

I think a checkpoint existing within the scope of a branch is a fair assumption for now (we may need to improve the docs to reflect this)

In my head:
`--commit:     read commit ‚Üí extract trailer ‚Üí call detail view with checkpoint id` - this is what you mean yeah?

### Prompt 6

at some future point we may want to 'cache' the `checkpoint -> commit` relationships

### Prompt 7

also add the this-branch vs all-branches complication, ideally our cache can handle all-branches if it can be fast enough

### Prompt 8

brainstorm for anything we've missed

# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section ...

### Prompt 10

1. üôà so ideally we want it _in_ the checkpoint metadata - I _think_ the author of the changes going into the checkpoint is more important than follow up changes like summarisation, but perhaps we need to show all parties involved...
2. nah you can always invoke git show et al if you want to see what is in the pure code commit; let's focus on the stuff we provide
3. yes mutually exclusive is fine
4. "no commits found on this branch" - see answer to 5.
5. let's add another flag ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏...

### Prompt 11

couldn't we do a git blame on the file or something similar?

### Prompt 12

we have one repo which already has 1033 commits on entire/sessions...is this still a good idea?

### Prompt 13

ok, option 2, detail view only for now

### Prompt 14

no, write the plan

# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration

## When to Use

### Prompt 18

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked to look at Linear issue ENT-212 about `entire explain` improvements.

2. **Linear Issue Content**: ENT-212 contains 4 requirements:
   - Show user associated with checkpoint (list + detail view)
   - Show same explain output when navigating via commit-...

### Prompt 19

have we pushed?

### Prompt 20

yes please

### Prompt 21

update to main please, we have conflicts

### Prompt 22

update the branch from remote, then let's github-pr-review

# GitHub PR Review

## Overview

Technical mechanics for GitHub PR review workflows via `gh` CLI. Covers fetching review comments, replying to threads, creating/updating PRs.

**Companion skill:** For *how to evaluate* feedback, see `superpowers:receiving-code-review`. This skill covers *how to interact* with GitHub.

**Security:** Use fine-grained PAT with minimal permissions.

### Prompt 24

okay, so this is a bit tangential, but we have some local context/entire explain output which is useful for us - we don't need to fix this now but we should create a new linear issue(s) at the end.

### Prompt 25

all of these should be in Project:Troy as well

let's tackle 222 first. Those are not different prompts, you can inspect each checkpoint to see the scoped transcript e.g. `entire explain -c c6e0fcd0aaed` and the same for 7bbf25eecc21

### Prompt 26

isn't this the 'multiple commits in the same checkpoint' case?

### Prompt 27

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Continue implementation of ENT-212 "entire explain improvements" (already completed in prior session)
   - Push branch and create PR #144
   - Resolve merge conflicts when updating to main
   - Address PR review comments (github-pr-review skill)
   - Create WIP Linear issues for tangential observation...

### Prompt 28

this is where I'm a bit confused with 222; if we're purely within a 'turn', when do we have separate checkpoints and when do we have multiple commits within a checkpoint?

### Prompt 29

there is some functionality where later commits can be added to a prior checkpoint...see this one also:
