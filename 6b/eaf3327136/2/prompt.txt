# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - One-off test script if no framework
   - MUST have before fixing
   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   **STOP and question fundamentals:**
   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
   - Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

   **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

   This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

**Related skills:**
- **superpowers:test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1)
- **superpowers:verification-before-completion** - Verify fix worked before claiming success

## Real-World Impact

From debugging sessions:
- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common

# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

## Task Structure

```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
```

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development
- Stay in this session
- Fresh subagent per task + code review

**If Parallel Session chosen:**
- Guide them to open new session in worktree
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** New session uses superpowers:executing-plans

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. User invoked `/systematic-debugging` skill to investigate slow stop hooks
2. I explored the codebase to understand the stop hook system using an Explore agent
3. I read key files: hooks_claudecode_handlers.go, transcript.go, state.go, manual_commit_git.go, temporary.go
4. I identified potential issues: double transcript parsing in CalculateTotalTokenUsage, redundant git status calls in ComputeNewFiles/ComputeDeletedFiles
5. I added timing instrumentation to measure actual performance
6. User redirected me to use `git clone git@github.com:entirehq/entire.io.git` instead of copying files
7. User told me to fetch the remote entire/sessions branch and delete local first
8. I ran multiple timing tests showing:
   - ComputeNewFiles + ComputeDeletedFiles: ~85-125ms (redundant)
   - SaveChanges: ~200-260ms
   - Total: ~400-425ms in 381-file repo
9. User invoked `/superpowers:write-plan` and asked me to check test coverage first
10. I examined test files and created the implementation plan
11. I offered execution options - awaiting user choice

Key files modified with timing instrumentation that needs to be removed:
- hooks_claudecode_handlers.go
- agent/claudecode/transcript.go

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user wanted to investigate why "stop hooks are running quite slowly in some cases" and fix the performance issues. After systematic debugging revealed the root causes, the user requested a written implementation plan with test coverage verification before making changes.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Claude Code stop hook system (`entire hooks claude-code stop`)
   - go-git v5 `worktree.Status()` performance characteristics
   - Transcript parsing (JSONL format) for token usage calculation
   - Shadow branch strategy for checkpoint storage
   - Session state management in `.git/entire-sessions/`
   - TDD approach for implementation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go`
     - Main stop hook handler `commitWithMetadata()`
     - Modified to add timing instrumentation (needs removal)
     - Key issue: calls `ComputeNewFiles` and `ComputeDeletedFiles` separately
     ```go
     // Current redundant calls:
     newFiles, err := ComputeNewFiles(preState)
     deletedFiles, err := ComputeDeletedFiles()
     ```

   - `cmd/entire/cli/agent/claudecode/transcript.go`
     - `CalculateTotalTokenUsage` parses transcript TWICE
     - Modified to add timing (needs removal)
     ```go
     // Issue: Double parsing
     mainUsage, err := CalculateTokenUsageFromFile(transcriptPath, startLine)  // First parse
     transcript, err := parseTranscriptFromLine(transcriptPath, startLine)      // Second parse
     agentIDs := ExtractSpawnedAgentIDs(transcript)
     ```

   - `cmd/entire/cli/state.go`
     - `ComputeNewFiles` and `ComputeDeletedFiles` each call `openRepository()` and `worktree.Status()` separately
     - Plan: Consolidate into single `ComputeFileChanges` function

   - `docs/plans/2026-02-04-stop-hook-performance.md`
     - Created implementation plan with 4 tasks
     - Contains test code and refactored implementations

4. Errors and fixes:
   - Attempted to copy CLI repo files manually
     - User redirected: "why don't you just do a `git clone git@github.com:entirehq/entire.io.git` instead"
   - Attempted to fetch remote branch without deleting local
     - User redirected: "and maybe delete the one you just created first otherwise it will conflict"
     - Fixed by running `git branch -D entire/sessions` then `git fetch origin entire/sessions:entire/sessions`

5. Problem Solving:
   - Identified root causes through timing instrumentation:
     - `ComputeNewFiles + ComputeDeletedFiles`: ~85-125ms combined (calling git status twice)
     - `SaveChanges`: ~200-260ms (git tree building - inherent cost)
     - Double transcript parsing: ~0.3-0.6ms overhead
   - Timing data collected from entire.io repo (381 files, 4027 files in entire/sessions tree):
     - Total stop hook: ~400-425ms
   - Test coverage verified: existing integration tests in `hooks_test.go` exercise full stop hook flow

6. All user messages:
   - Invoked `/systematic-debugging` skill with args: "the stop hooks are running quite slowly in some cases; can we figure out why?"
   - "yes, add instrumentation and quantify the issues"
   - "why don't you just do a `git clone git@github.com:entirehq/entire.io.git` instead"
   - "and maybe delete the one you just created first otherwise it will conflict"
   - Invoked `/superpowers:write-plan` with args: "first. check we have good test coverage so we don't break things as well"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Execute the implementation plan (4 tasks):
     - Task 1: Remove timing instrumentation
     - Task 2: Consolidate git status calls into `ComputeFileChanges`
     - Task 3: Eliminate double transcript parsing in `CalculateTotalTokenUsage`
     - Task 4: Final verification

8. Current Work:
   I just completed creating the implementation plan at `docs/plans/2026-02-04-stop-hook-performance.md` and offered execution options:
   
   "Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/2026-02-04-stop-hook-performance.md`. Two execution options:
   
   **1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration
   
   **2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints
   
   Which approach?"

9. Optional Next Step:
   Await user's choice between subagent-driven or parallel session execution approach, then begin implementing the plan starting with Task 1 (Remove Timing Instrumentation). The timing instrumentation was added to:
   - `cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` - multiple `[timing]` stderr prints
   - `cmd/entire/cli/agent/claudecode/transcript.go` - timing variables t1, t2, t3, t4 and `time` import

# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
