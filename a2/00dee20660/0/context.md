# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

when doing `entire resume` we might flag to the user he should also pull `entire/sessions` can we just do this automatically instead?

### Prompt 2

can you check, I think this might be duplicated now in the code base: Added FetchMetadataBranch() function
