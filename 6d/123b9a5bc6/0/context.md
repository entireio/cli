# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

can we add a hidden "debug" command, and the first subcommand I'd want to add is `entire debug auto-commit` and the idea is that it shows if the current state would lead to an auto commit or not (assuming the current state on filesystem is sufficient? or is it dependend from the hook content?)

### Prompt 2

I updated the main branch, can you check again? the main branch allow thing has gone away

### Prompt 3

what is it testing?

### Prompt 4

yeah 2 and 3

### Prompt 5

can it now figure out the transcript file itself?
