We should add the agent name to any logging

---

can we add a simple tests assuming we have tests for logging?

---

I can't see any usage in our code of logging.WithAgent so, means that we are not really logging the agent any where.  
Tell me where we should add the agent into context.

---

Implement 1,2 and 3.
