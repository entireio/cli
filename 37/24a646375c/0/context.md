# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

when running: 
❯ entire enable

✓ Enabled (manual-commit)

I'd like us to show more what else is setup. Like for each step there should be a check mark listed. Can you take a look and propose change?

### Prompt 2

Instead of "Strategy initialized" we should do "<strategy name> strategy initialized" and remove "(manual-commit)" from "Enabled"
