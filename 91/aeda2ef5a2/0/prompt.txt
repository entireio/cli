can you review pr 227 for me?

---

Right now to make CI work it fakes binaries, this means tests would also fail on my machine if I hadn't gemini or claude installed. While this is still ok this will add friction the more agents the CLI support, can you check for a better solution?

---

The cleanest approach is to add an unexported lookPath field to each agent struct that tests can inject: - feels like cluttering the real code with requirements for tests, but it's a common pattern in go?

---

can you check out the branch and we do the struct approach?

can we fix:  2. Error message casing                                                                                                                                                                Go convention is lowercase error messages:
