I want to talk about AWS and other secrets. Can you generate me a list of plausible-looking API tokens for:

- slack webhook
- aws secret keys
- postgres database env vars?

I'll be using them for my documentation.

The AWS keys aren't realistic enough, they contain the word EXAMPLE.  Also, please give me an example JTW.

---

Great.  I'll see if these end up in the transcript.

---

Yes that's exactly what i'm doing.  Let's talk about secrets a bit more.  Generate me some more examples.  I liked the JWT.

Thanks!

Now, make an edit to README.md, and briefly explain the output_filter option.
