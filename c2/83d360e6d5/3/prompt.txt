can you take a look at this? I would have expected that the UserPromptSubmit would have surfaced this in claude (blocking the prompt) as usual and not dump an error including tool usage help: 

  If you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at:

  ⎿  UserPromptSubmit hook error: Failed with non-blocking status code: Captured state before prompt: 0 untracked files

     Warning: Session ID conflict detected!

        Shadow branch: entire/aa7be8c
        Existing session: 2026-01-20-c2b51eb0-d0e9-43cf-b431-42c05d49450b
        New session: 2026-01-20-9de86e4e-9df7-46f3-abb7-09b836f8dc9b

        The shadow branch already has checkpoints from a different session.
        Starting a new session would orphan the existing work.

        Options:
        1. Commit your changes (git commit) to create a new base commit
        2. Run 'entire rewind reset' to discard the shadow branch and start fresh
        3. Resume the existing session: claude -r c2b51eb0-d0e9-43cf-b431-42c05d49450b

        To suppress this warning in future sessions, run:
          entire enable --disable-multisession-warning

     Usage:
       entire hooks claude-code user-prompt-submit [flags]

     Flags:
       -h, --help   help for user-prompt-submit

     session ID conflict: session ID conflict: shadow branch has commits from a different session
     exit status 1

how does a concurent session differ from the session id conflict?

---

ah the different is that we got the hook from the first session being stopped?

---

[Request interrupted by user]

---

ah the different is that we got the hook from the first claude being closed?

---

can you do the fix?

---

can you explain me the difference between ShadowBranchConflictError and SessionIDConflictError

---

can we add a test for each to at least check it's returning the blocking (but not error) response?
