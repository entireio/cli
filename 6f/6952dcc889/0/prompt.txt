# GitHub PR Review

## Overview

Technical mechanics for GitHub PR review workflows via `gh` CLI. Covers fetching review comments, replying to threads, creating/updating PRs.

**Companion skill:** For *how to evaluate* feedback, see `superpowers:receiving-code-review`. This skill covers *how to interact* with GitHub.

**Security:** Use fine-grained PAT with minimal permissions.

## Setup (One-Time)

### Fine-Grained PAT

Create at github.com -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens:

| Permission | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Pull requests | Read & Write |
| Contents | Read |

**Can't:** Delete repos, push code, delete branches, manage settings.

### Configure & Allowlist

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="github_pat_xxxx"
```

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(gh repo view:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr view:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr create:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr ready:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr edit:*)",
      "Bash(gh api repos/*/*/pulls/*/comments:*)",
      "Bash(gh api repos/*/*/pulls/*/comments/*/replies:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Quick Reference

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Get owner/repo | `gh repo view --json owner,name -q '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'` |
| Get PR number | `gh pr view --json number -q .number` |
| Get PR author | `gh pr view --json author -q .author.login` |
| Fetch all review comments | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments --paginate` |
| Get single comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}` |
| Reply to comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -f body="msg"` |
| Create PR | `gh pr create --title "T" --body "B" [--draft]` |
| Mark ready | `gh pr ready [number]` |
| Convert to draft | `gh pr ready --undo [number]` |
| Edit PR | `gh pr edit [number] --title "T" --body "B"` |

## Workflow: Respond to PR Review

### 1. Get repo info and PR details

```bash
owner_repo=$(gh repo view --json owner,name -q '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"')
pr_number=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
pr_author=$(gh pr view --json author -q .author.login)
```

### 2. Fetch and analyze threads

```bash
# Fetch all comments and group into threads, showing last author per thread
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments --paginate | jq 'sort_by([.in_reply_to_id // .id, .created_at]) | group_by(.in_reply_to_id // .id) | map({thread_id: (.[0].in_reply_to_id // .[0].id), path: .[0].path, line: (.[0].line // .[0].original_line), last_author: .[-1].user.login, last_body: .[-1].body[0:100], count: length})'
```

### 3. Filter to threads needing response

```bash
# Filter to threads where last_author != PR author
# Note: Use '| not' instead of '!=' to avoid shell escaping issues with !
... | jq --arg author "$pr_author" '[.[] | select(.last_author == $author | not)]'
```

For each thread needing response:
- Read the comment + file/line context
- Apply `superpowers:receiving-code-review` skill for evaluation
- Fix code and/or reply to thread

### 4. Commit fixes and push
- run the build, tests, linting as required
- commit the changes, noting the commit sha
- push the changes so they're visible
- We need to do this FIRST so we have the commit shas to put into the replies to the pr review

### 5. Re-fetch comment IDs (if rebased)

**Important:** If you rebased or force-pushed, comment IDs may have changed. Re-fetch the comment threads before replying:

```bash
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments --paginate | jq '...'
```

### 6. Reply to a thread

```bash
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123. [description of fix]"
```

### 7. Summarize and finish

After all threads addressed, ask if ready to mark PR ready for review.

**Note:** REST API doesn't expose "resolved" status. We infer "done" when PR author made last comment in thread.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Broad PAT permissions | Use fine-grained PAT with only Pull requests + Contents |
| Missing pagination | Always use `--paginate` for comment fetching |
| Top-level reply | Use `/comments/{id}/replies` endpoint, not `/comments` |
| Re-responding to threads | Skip threads where PR author made last comment |
| Forgetting to reply after fix | Always reply to confirm the fix was made |
| jq `!=` fails with shell error | Use `select(.x == "y" \| not)` instead of `select(.x != "y")` |
| 404 on reply after rebase | Comment IDs change after force-push/rebase. Re-fetch comments before replying |

ehh, in this _specific_ gemini case, can we not get the sessionId off the hook payload?

(also I thought we'd removed the concept of entireSessionId?)

also have a look at some of the open PRs, there are some gemini specific ones that may be related to this...

---

hmm, I feel like this stdin consumption is limiting. let's check the other PRs first

---

I mean this is already the "everything else PR" so why the heck not.

Is there any reason we don't parse the stdin on entry? is there some streaming aspect?

---

where are all the callers of commitWithMetadataGemini?

---

...why does the method exist at all?

---

if we did that do we stuff up the other PRs?

---

hmm, 162 is already generally affected by our state machine stuff no?

---

yeah let's do it
