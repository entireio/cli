# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace
- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

---

I think A) is fine, let's add it to metadata.json. For the first cut, can we do a targeted `entire explain -c {checkpoint_id} --generate`? this will be easier to test and iterate on

---

A) So, I am thinking for Learnings:
1. General purpose for future sessions in this repo
2. Specific things related to a section of the code
3. General purpose for the dev workflow

Friction should capture all problems and annoyances faced. Should friction be sub-grouped as per the learnings?

Let's also add a top level field for the concept of 'tech debt' or things we have left open (perhaps unfinished) for now which we should remember for later

B) yeah let's go json. we can always render it on the way out (I don't think claude code/agents will be reading metadata.json directly)

---

CodeLearning needs line number refs

---

the call to the LLM to generate the output needs to be configurable (can be hard coded to start with but this is the intention)

what's the best way to provide the transcripts? they are quite large...

---

I think B), let's start with all user prompts, assistant responses and key tool actions (they must be chronologically in order right?) - can't we see the modified files from the tool call (file) actions?

---

C)

---

do we need to do a superpowers write-plan or is what we have sufficient?

---

# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess

---

okay, commit this batch as is, then run a review; let's add a task to the todo directly following this

---

<bash-input>git status</bash-input>

---

<bash-stdout>On branch alex/ent-108-add-ai-summaries
nothing to commit, working tree clean</bash-stdout><bash-stderr></bash-stderr>

---

let's go with #4 and #5 please, though can we stick to the workflow of subagent dev and review?

---

commit, push, create draft PR

---

debug: I am seeing
`failed to generate summary: failed to parse summary JSON: unexpected end of JSON input (response: )`
when running `./entire explain -c c1c35c964733 --generate --no-pager`

---

can you write me a linear issue in Project:Troy to log this behaviour as a bug -> investigate hooks interfering with command line `claude -p` behaviour` (might have something to do with the session conflict behaviour)

---

ok let's keep going

---

C) update this branch from alex/ent-109-text-output-checkpoint-flag first, then let's tackle #10

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked to look at Linear issue ENT-108 about creating AI summaries for checkpoints using Claude CLI.

2. **Design Phase**: I used the brainstorming skill to design the feature:
   - Schema: CheckpointSummary with Intent, Outcome, Learnings (Repo/Code/Workflow), Friction, OpenItems
   - CodeLearning includes Path, Line, EndLine, Finding
   - Use Claude CLI with --print --output-format json
   - Condensed transcript format for LLM input

3. **Implementation Phase** (using executing-plans skill):
   - Task 1: Added Summary types to checkpoint/checkpoint.go
   - Task 2: Created summarize.go with SummaryGenerator interface, BuildCondensedTranscript, FormatCondensedTranscript
   - Task 3: Created summarize_claude.go with ClaudeCLIGenerator
   - Task 4: Added --generate and --force flags to explain.go
   - Task 5: Added UpdateSummary persistence method to committed.go
   - Task 6-8: Tests added
   - Task 9: Lint and test runs

4. **Key User Feedback**:
   - "should we be using the StripIDE code from textutil?" - Yes, use existing textutil.StripIDEContextTags
   - "prefer subagents to save on the main context" - Use Task subagents for development
   - "could also move all of this into its own package..." - Task #10 created
   - "can we also review the work we've done so far? we should do a commit as well"
   - "let's go with #4 and #5 please, though can we stick to the workflow of subagent dev and review?"
   - "are these 'any's really the way to go?" - Keep interface{} for consistency with existing codebase

5. **Bug Fix**: Claude CLI returning empty response when run from repo with hooks configured:
   - Root cause: Project hooks in .claude/settings.json interfere with --print mode
   - Fix: Added --setting-sources user flag to skip project settings
   - Created Linear issue ENT-140 to track this behavior

6. **Review Feedback Addressed** (Tasks 11, 12):
   - Extracted shared user content extraction logic
   - Added configurable ClaudePath field
   - Added security comment about transcript tags
   - Removed redundant ID truncation
   - Improved commit message for UpdateSummary

7. **Current State**: User asked to update from alex/ent-109-text-output-checkpoint-flag branch before tackling Task #10 (refactor to separate package). Merge conflict occurred in checkpoint.go - I was in the middle of resolving it but left a syntax error (missing closing brace for InitialAttribution struct).

Key files:
- cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint/checkpoint.go - Summary, LearningsSummary, CodeLearning types + InitialAttribution from merge
- cmd/entire/cli/summarize.go - SummaryGenerator interface, SummaryInput, TranscriptEntry, BuildCondensedTranscript, FormatCondensedTranscript
- cmd/entire/cli/summarize_claude.go - ClaudeCLIGenerator with --setting-sources user fix
- cmd/entire/cli/explain.go - --generate and --force flags, generateCheckpointSummary function
- cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint/committed.go - UpdateSummary method
- cmd/entire/cli/transcript.go - extractUserContentFromMessage helper

Commits made:
1. feat(summarize): add AI summary types and Claude CLI generator
2. feat(explain): add --generate and --force flags for AI summaries
3. fix(summarize): skip project hooks when calling Claude CLI
4. refactor(summarize): address review feedback

Current error: Missing closing brace for InitialAttribution struct after merge conflict resolution.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested implementation of Linear issue ENT-108: "Create (AI) summaries based on the entire context for a checkpoint". The goal is to replace heuristic summary extraction with AI-powered summarization using Claude CLI. Key requirements:
   - Add `--generate` flag to `entire explain -c <checkpoint>` command
   - Use Claude CLI (not SDK) since user already has it authenticated
   - Generate structured summaries with: Intent, Outcome, Learnings (Repo/Code/Workflow with line numbers), Friction, OpenItems
   - Persist summaries to checkpoint metadata.json
   - Support `--force` flag to regenerate existing summaries

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - SummaryGenerator interface for configurable LLM backends
   - ClaudeCLIGenerator shells out to `claude --print --output-format json --setting-sources user`
   - Condensed transcript format: [User], [Assistant], [Tool] entries in chronological order
   - checkpoint.Summary stored in CommittedMetadata on entire/sessions branch
   - CodeLearning struct with Path, Line, EndLine, Finding fields
   - textutil.StripIDEContextTags for cleaning prompts
   - Git operations for updating metadata on entire/sessions branch

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint/checkpoint.go**
     - Core types for AI summaries, currently has merge conflict being resolved
     ```go
     // Summary contains AI-generated summary of a checkpoint.
     type Summary struct {
         Intent    string           `json:"intent"`
         Outcome   string           `json:"outcome"`
         Learnings LearningsSummary `json:"learnings"`
         Friction  []string         `json:"friction"`
         OpenItems []string         `json:"open_items"`
     }
     
     type LearningsSummary struct {
         Repo     []string       `json:"repo"`
         Code     []CodeLearning `json:"code"`
         Workflow []string       `json:"workflow"`
     }
     
     type CodeLearning struct {
         Path    string `json:"path"`
         Line    int    `json:"line,omitempty"`
         EndLine int    `json:"end_line,omitempty"`
         Finding string `json:"finding"`
     }
     ```

   - **cmd/entire/cli/summarize.go**
     - Interface and transcript condensation logic
     ```go
     type SummaryGenerator interface {
         Generate(ctx context.Context, input SummaryInput) (*checkpoint.Summary, error)
     }
     
     type SummaryInput struct {
         Transcript   []TranscriptEntry
         FilesTouched []string
     }
     
     func BuildCondensedTranscript(transcript []transcriptLine) []TranscriptEntry
     func FormatCondensedTranscript(input SummaryInput) string
     ```

   - **cmd/entire/cli/summarize_claude.go**
     - Claude CLI integration with project hooks fix
     ```go
     type ClaudeCLIGenerator struct {
         ClaudePath    string  // defaults to "claude"
         CommandRunner func(ctx context.Context, name string, args ...string) *exec.Cmd
     }
     
     // Key fix: --setting-sources user to skip project hooks
     cmd := runner(ctx, claudePath, "--print", "--output-format", "json", "--setting-sources", "user")
     ```

   - **cmd/entire/cli/explain.go**
     - Added --generate and --force flags, generateCheckpointSummary function
     - formatCheckpointOutput updated to display AI summaries

   - **cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint/committed.go**
     - Added UpdateSummary method for persisting summaries

   - **cmd/entire/cli/transcript.go**
     - Added extractUserContentFromMessage helper to eliminate code duplication
     - Added contentTypeToolUse constant

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Empty Claude CLI response**: When running from repo with hooks in .claude/settings.json, `claude --print` returned empty results with 0 tokens
     - Fix: Added `--setting-sources user` flag to skip project settings
     - Created Linear ENT-140 to track this bug
   
   - **Code duplication warning**: extractUserEntry duplicated extractUserPromptAt logic
     - Fix: Extracted shared logic into extractUserContentFromMessage helper
   
   - **interface{} vs any linter warnings**: Linter suggested using `any` instead of `interface{}`
     - User feedback: Keep `interface{}` for consistency with existing codebase
   
   - **Current merge conflict**: Resolving merge from alex/ent-109-text-output-checkpoint-flag
     - Missing closing brace for InitialAttribution struct after resolution attempt

5. Problem Solving:
   - Designed schema through iterative Q&A (Intent, Outcome, Learnings with 3 categories, Friction, OpenItems)
   - Solved transcript size problem by condensing to user/assistant/tool entries only
   - Diagnosed Claude CLI empty response issue by testing from /tmp vs repo directory
   - Used subagents for development work per user preference to save main context

6. All User Messages:
   - "have a look at linear ENT-108, we will work on that here"
   - "I think A) is fine, let's add it to metadata.json. For the first cut, can we do a targeted `entire explain -c {checkpoint_id} --generate`?"
   - "A) So, I am thinking for Learnings: 1. General purpose for future sessions in this repo 2. Specific things related to a section of the code 3. General purpose for the dev workflow. Friction should capture all problems and annoyances faced. Should friction be sub-grouped as per the learnings? Let's also add a top level field for the concept of 'tech debt'..."
   - "CodeLearning needs line number refs"
   - "C)" (choosing --force flag approach)
   - "should we be using the StripIDE code from textutil?"
   - "can we do this in a subagent? - also WRITE TESTS"
   - "prefer subagents to save on the main context"
   - "could also move all of this into its own package..."
   - "can we also review the work we've done so far? we should do a commit as well"
   - "don't check this in" (about design doc)
   - "do we need to do a superpowers write-plan or is what we have sufficient?"
   - "let's go with #4 and #5 please, though can we stick to the workflow of subagent dev and review?"
   - "let me know when you're done with the dev changes"
   - "commit, push, create draft PR"
   - "debug: I am seeing `failed to generate summary: failed to parse summary JSON: unexpected end of JSON input (response: )` when running `./entire explain -c c1c35c964733 --generate --no-pager`"
   - "let's not do the nuclear thing" (about --dangerously-skip-permissions)
   - "can you write me a linear issue in Project:Troy to log this behaviour as a bug..."
   - "ok let's keep going"
   - "are these 'any's really the way to go?"
   - "C) update this branch from alex/ent-109-text-output-checkpoint-flag first, then let's tackle #10"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - #10: Refactor summarize code into separate package (cmd/entire/cli/summarize/)
   - Complete merge conflict resolution from alex/ent-109-text-output-checkpoint-flag

8. Current Work:
   Resolving merge conflict in cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint/checkpoint.go after merging alex/ent-109-text-output-checkpoint-flag. The conflict involved both branches adding fields to CommittedMetadata:
   - Our branch: Summary *Summary and related types
   - Other branch: InitialAttribution *InitialAttribution and related type
   
   I resolved the conflict to keep both but left a syntax error - missing closing brace for InitialAttribution struct at line 403. The file currently shows:
   ```go
   type InitialAttribution struct {
       CalculatedAt    time.Time `json:"calculated_at"`
       AgentLines      int       `json:"agent_lines"`
       // ... more fields ...
       AgentPercentage float64   `json:"agent_percentage"`
   
   // Info provides summary information...  <-- Missing } here
   type Info struct {
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Fix the missing closing brace in checkpoint.go line 403 (add `}` after AgentPercentage field), then run build/tests to verify merge, commit the merge, and proceed with Task #10 (refactor to separate package).
   
   User's explicit request: "C) update this branch from alex/ent-109-text-output-checkpoint-flag first, then let's tackle #10"
