on which data does "entire session list" operates?

---

what value is shown in the last column of session list?

---

Could we show the commit message instead? Like there should always be a commit matching the session, for auto-commit this is then usually also the prompt but for manual-commit it might be a more descriptive thing

---

Option 1 doesn't work since the commit hash can change, that's why we add the "Entire-Checkpoint" trailer to the real commits. Since that is the stable link. I wonder now if we should add this to CLAUDE.md somehow so you remember this?

---

In theory the commits we look at should have either nearly the same date or a newer date then the commit date the commit in entire/sessions has.

---

you wrote: So we can use the checkpoint's CreatedAt timestamp as an upper bound and search backwards from there. 
what does upper bound means here? just to be sure, the date of the commit in entire/sessions never change but a user could rebase/ammend a commit containing the actual change so it is then newer then the commit in entire/sessions. I mostly meant it's not worth looking more then a few minutes older then the commit in entire/sessions but then up to now. Does this make sense?

---

yes, exactly, please implement this.
