can you check how we load .claude/settings.json is it removing any hook types we don't know in the code base?

---

and other unknown top level fields?

---

ok, I think we should change that to not be strict, we don't want to play catch up and add new hook types constantly so I rather would like to have something more flexible

---

are we testing also that if other hooks are already defined for the same hook types we use that we keep them and add ours to the array?

---

Two issues to fix:
  1. Unused variable stopHookCount at line 485 - incremented but never asserted
  2. Long test function - TestInstallHooks_PreservesUserHooksOnSameType (~120 lines) could be split into subtests with t.Run()

  Minor suggestions: rename containsDenyRule to containsRule, add content verification for SubagentStop hook.

---

are we using t.RunParallel where we could?

---

question: are we doing similar things with the gemini hooks?

---

do we have the same tests there?

---

could we easily deduplicate the code between both agents? or is that to much effort right now? Fine to do it later too
