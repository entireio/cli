I'm currently getting this error in /Users/soph/Work/entire/devenv/entire.io, and there are no uncommited changes:

is the cli adding this to the global git ignore? I don't recall adding it there myself

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

using the git cli for this should be fine, since it's always against the current local worktree, right? (we use go-git explicitly in other places to not be dependent on a checkout filetree of a branch)

---

can we add a test for this? it's hard to simulate global git ignore I guess?

---

but is this the same, the issue was with global git ignore, local gitignore was already covered and working!?

---

stop for a second, so the issue was /Users/soph/.config/git/ignore had .claude/settings.local.json ignored, that was not catched by `go-git`

---

but while that test is running my local git config is messed up, right?
