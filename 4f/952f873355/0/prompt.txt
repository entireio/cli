what was the name of the field we store the agent type in metadata.json again?

---

can you check this code is actually working? because I just tested and I don't see it in metadata.json nor the trailer on the commit in entire/sessions which should also be there, right?

---

can we fix this?

---

can we add a test (probably integration?) that tests this works end2end?

---

can you check these tests couldn't be integrated into existing tests? don't change anything, just let me know

---

I'd like to integrate 1.+2. and for 3 I'd like to create a general test that validates the other trailers too.
