can you review the changes in this branch?

---

can you check if there is any public documentation for  CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE

---

ah the docs actually mentioning using a hook for this, can we change this? So the hook will setup mise + dns?

---

can you do a web search if others have the DNS issue too?

---

one more issue I've seen when running tests: Ran tests - Found 2 failing tests:
TestGetGitDirInPath_Worktree
TestIsGitSequenceOperation_Worktree
Diagnosed the issue - The tests failed because the environment has commit.gpgsign=true globally configured, causing git commits in test repos to fail with signing errors
Fixed the tests - Added git config commit.gpgsign false to both worktree tests to disable signing in test repositories

---

I thinkt you got an API error?

---

can you explain the GPG changes to me and what impact they have on test coverage?

---

Do we need the change in CLAUDE.md at all then? it shoudl just work out of the box through the hook, right?

---

any ideas: This script’s PATH/activation changes won’t affect later hooks because .claude/settings.json runs it as a separate command; the subsequent go run ... will still use whatever go is on the parent environment’s PATH.

---

do you have a link to the docs?

---

wouldn't it be better to just add `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` to the CLAUDE_ENV_FILE then?

---

but I'm wondering now: the docs sound like only `export ..` lines are suported
