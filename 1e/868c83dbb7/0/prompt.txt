Can you read docs/architecture/shadow-branch-suffixes.md, I'd like to modify this approach: I don't think we need suffixes but instead we just use one branch, is there overlap in files we continue, if there is no overlap and the new session did create local changes, then we reset the shadow branch to a clean state. Can you ultrathink about it and come up with a new plan?

---

the issue with the old solution is that there is also no way out of the edge case (5) since yes, we have the old branch, but figuring out that the user reset and then stash apply the old changes is not trivial either and wasn't part of the initial plan, we could build that later (and then use suffixed branches) but for now I think that just adds complexity

---

yes, but I think we should start relatively fresh from main branch, can you switch, write a new architecture document replacing the multi one

continue, network should be better now

---

one follow up: in case of "stash" -> new session, reset shadow branch when file changes happen -> can we reliable figure out when those file changes happen? Or would we rather track at the beginning of the new session that there is no overlap and by that keep a flag on the property that anything that would cause a checkpoint on the shadow branch will reset it?

---

If the second sessions would create files that do overlap (which is not unlikely) then we still should not continue. There is of course the issue that you do one prompt (no file changes yet, file system has still changes from prior session) and then decide "ok, this is better" and then reset the file directory. So I think at the beginning of a prompt we should do the comparision (are there still changes that belong to the prior session?) and keep that as a state. If there would be a call to SaveChanges during that prompt, then the flag decides what to do, if there isn't the flag is reset and we do another check at the next promp start. Does that make sense?

---

yes, update the architecture document first

---

can we add that we also invert the existing disable-multisession-warning and keep a functionality as today that you can enable and would always warn at the beginnig of a second session (and rerunning the prompt would mean merge the sessions)
