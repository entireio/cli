I'd like to update CLAUDE.md and docs/architecture to make sure the linking between `Entire-Checkpoint: random-id` on the code branch and `Checkpoint: random-id` on `entire/session` and shadow branches and then the random-id being used for folders. I think the current information is not clear and not up2daten in a places, please suggest improvements

yes

the first part is not correct, for manual-commits we use git hooks to also add the trailer to the commits, so both auto and manual commit add `Entire-Checkpoint` Trailer

For 312 there is also the approach to search the commit that has the `Checkpoint: <id>` message/trailer

again, this is not correct:

 299 +User commit → Metadata:
 300 +  Extract "Entire-Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7" trailer
 301 +  → Look up a3/b2c4d5e6f7/ on entire/sessions branch
 302 +
 303 +Metadata → User commits:
 304 +  Given checkpoint ID a3b2c4d5e6f7
 305 +  → Search branch history for commits with "Entire-Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7"
 306 +  → Or search entire/sessions for commit with "Checkpoint: a3b2c4d5e6f7" subject
