I just tried to make a release with the .github/workflows/release.yml through go release and did run into this issue:  • sign & notarize macOS binaries
    • signing                                        binary=dist/cli_darwin_arm64_v8.0/entire
    • notarizing and waiting - this might take a while binary=dist/cli_darwin_arm64_v8.0/entire
      • took: 20m2s
  ⨯ release failed after 22m5s                       error=notarize: macos: notarize dist/cli_darwin_arm64_v8.0/entire: Get "https://appstoreconnect.apple.REDACTED": context deadline exceeded
Error: The process '/opt/hostedtoolcache/goreleaser-action/2.13.2/x64/goreleaser' failed with exit code 1

can you also add a single retry?
