### Prompt 1

Please fix my unit test issue

### Prompt 2

run the tests

### Prompt 3

Alright, for every test in redact/redact_test.go i'd like to see literal expectations (either byte slices or strings) instead of strings.Contains checks.  That'll make the tests easier to understand.

### Prompt 4

Almost there.  In func [REDACTED], i'd like us to make a literal structure that we directly compare to repls and repls2.  That'll make the test easier to grok.

### Prompt 5

Great, now finally do that to func TestCollectJSONLReplacements_Succeeds too
