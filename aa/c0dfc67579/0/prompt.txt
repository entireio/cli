can you run multiple agents reviewing the changes in the branch and also check if the approach is a best practice used by other clis installing git hooks?

Let's do these first: 

  1. Flatten the install branching logic — The three interleaved conditionals with a dangling if at line 169 are hard to follow. Simpler approach: (1) back up if needed, (2) chain if backup exists. Two sequential decisions instead of 6 code paths.

  2. Remove scanForMovedHooks — YAGNI. Handles a speculative scenario (another tool renaming our hooks to .pre-husky) that is unlikely and harmless if it occurs. Removes ~112 LOC including tests.

  3. Extract test setup helper — The 8-12 line git repo setup block is repeated 10 times. A initTestRepo(t) helper would save ~72 lines and make tests scannable.
