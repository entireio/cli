The calculatePromptAttributionAtStart function silently returns an empty result on multiple error conditions (lines 936-952, 963-971). While this is acceptable for optional attribution tracking, consider logging these errors at Debug level to help diagnose issues where attribution is unexpectedly missing.

For example, if the shadow branch exists but has corruption, or if git operations fail due to permissions issues, the attribution will be silently skipped with no visibility into why. Adding debug logs here (similar to the ones in manual_commit_condensation.go lines 139-177) would improve debuggability.
