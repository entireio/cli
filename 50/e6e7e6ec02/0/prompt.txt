can you look at the changes in the branch and also figure out when this issue was introduced and show me the commit, can you then also go to it's checkpoint and summarize the session log that lead to this change?

---

But the fixes of that session are still intact or did we break anything that was intented to be fixed before? Or is the issue that was tried to fix still open?

---

can you check if it's worth tracking the PendingCheckpointID logic in CLAUDE.md or in docs/architecture for future reference?

---

yes
