can you check if there would be issues doing "entire resume" in a repo that uses a https url instead of a git url?

---

yes

---

The gosec suppression comment is inaccurate: branchName is passed from entire resume <branch> (user-provided CLI arg), not derived from existing git refs. Please either (a) validate branchName as a safe refname (e.g., git check-ref-format --branch or equivalent) before constructing the refspec, or (b) update the suppression rationale to reflect the real trust boundary.

git fetch is run with context.Background() and no timeout. Since this is a network operation, it can hang indefinitely (especially in CI/headless environments). Consider using context.WithTimeout (similar to strategy/push_common.go) so the command is guaranteed to terminate and returns a clear timeout error.

---

The error returned from fetchCmd.CombinedOutput() is checked but not included in the error message. Unlike CheckoutBranch which uses %w to wrap both the output and the error, the new fetch code only includes the output string. If git fails without producing output (e.g., git executable not found, permission issues), the error message becomes "failed to fetch branch from origin: " with no diagnostic information, making failures harder to debug.

FetchMetadataBranch runs git fetch with context.Background() and no timeout. Consider using context.WithTimeout for this network operation to avoid indefinite hangs and provide a clearer failure mode
