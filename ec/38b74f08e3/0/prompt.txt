Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Update Multi-Session Warning Message

## Goal
Replace the technical "Session ID conflict" warning with a friendlier message (Option C).

## File to Modify
- `cmd/entire/cli/hooks.go` (lines 319-336)

## Change

Replace the current message:
```go
message := fmt.Sprintf(
    "Warning: Session ID conflict detected!\n\n"+
        "%s"+
        "Existing session: %s\n"+
        "New session: %s\n\n"+
        "The shadow branch already has checkpoints from a different session.\n"+
        "Starting a new session would orphan the existing work.\n\n"+
        "Options:\n"+
        "1. Commit your changes (git commit) to create a new base commit\n"+
        "2. Run 'entire rewind reset' to discard the shadow branch and start fresh\n"+
        "3. Resume the existing session: %s\n\n"+
        "To suppress this warning in future sessions, run:\n"+
        "  entire enable --disable-multisession-warning",
    shadowBranchInfo,
    existingSessionState.SessionID,
    sessionID,
    resumeCmd,
)
```

With:
```go
message := fmt.Sprintf(
    "Another session has uncommitted checkpoints.\n\n"+
        "• Continue here - both sessions' work will be preserved\n"+
        "• Resume that session: %s\n\n"+
        "To hide this notice: entire enable --disable-multisession-warning",
    resumeCmd,
)
```

## Cleanup
- Remove unused variables: `shadowBranchInfo`, `hasShadowBranch`, `shadowBranch`, and related code
- Remove unused imports if any (`plumbing`, `checkpoint`) become orphaned

## Verification
- Run `mise run fmt && mise run lint` to ensure code compiles
- Run `mise run test` to verify no test breakage

---

do not stash anything, read the files you need

---

add another option which is, if the user wants to discard previous sessions work on current work, run "entire reset --force"

---

not sure if checkpoints is a meaninful word. alternatives? session's conversation ? it is related to agent chat, claude or gemini.

---

instead of "Another sessions..." Print something like.
"You are currently running a claude code session (<sessionid>).
Do you want to keep going with this new sessions <sessionid>?
Yes. Ignore this warning
No.

Yes. Ignore this warning
No. type /exit and you can either:
- continue other sessions: command to restart session
- reset any current session work by "entire reset --force" and start a brand new session <claude or gemini>

To hide this notice in the future ...

add test that checks this new way of handling session conflicts. Which only happens at session start hook
