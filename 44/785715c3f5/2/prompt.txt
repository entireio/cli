yeah let's do it

---

ok, so I am noting some weirdness.

In one of _our commits_ 09ea3c1e2b76a240fadcd7c0594744be77348a94 (we did this just now), it is referencing checkpoint e6d2bbd73e25.

That checkpoint seems...unrelated?

---

is this a timing problem?

---

how big is the fix?

---

so there's no way to get the correct checkpoint in this case...?

---

how can we be committing with nothing to condense? claude has done 2 commits without any prompts in between?

---

I don't think the reviewer would have been making commits. and as you note, the commits are nearly a minute apart. you're about to run out of context so let's compact and come at this fresh

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was continued from a previous session that ran out of context. The summary indicated:
   - Working on ENT-109: `--checkpoint` flag + tiered verbosity for `entire explain` command
   - Tasks 1-7 were completed (TDD approach)
   - Currently on Task 8: Implement default output format

2. **Completed Tasks 8-15**: 
   - Task 8: Implemented default checkpoint output format (formatCheckpointOutput function)
   - Task 9: Wrote failing test for verbose output
   - Task 10: Implemented verbose output (files, prompts sections)
   - Task 11: Wrote failing test for full output
   - Task 12: Implemented full output (transcript section)
   - Task 13: Added integration tests for --checkpoint flag
   - Task 14: Ran full test suite and lint
   - Task 15: Updated help text

3. **User requested adding commit message to verbose mode**:
   - Used TDD approach
   - Added `commitMessage` parameter to `formatCheckpointOutput`
   - Added `findCommitMessageForCheckpoint` helper function
   - Created tests for with/without commit message scenarios

4. **User requested moving commit message before file list**:
   - Reordered sections in verbose output

5. **User asked about diagnostic issues**:
   - QF1012 lint warnings about using `fmt.Fprintf` instead of `sb.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(...))`
   - Fixed all instances in `formatSessionInfo` and `formatCommitInfo` functions

6. **Bug Investigation**: User noticed commit 09ea3c1 referenced checkpoint e6d2bbd73e25 which is from an unrelated old session. This led to investigation of:
   - The checkpoint is from session `2026-01-19-c2b51eb0-...` on branch `alex/ent-53-improve-explain`
   - Current session is `2026-01-21-0cf3db51-...`
   - The prepare-commit-msg hook's fallback logic that uses ALL sessions when none match current HEAD
   - Log analysis showing discrepancy between content existing and hook saying "no new content"

7. **Root Cause Investigation**:
   - Examined `manual_commit_hooks.go` for how checkpoint IDs are determined
   - Found fallback logic at lines 217-221 that falls back to ALL sessions
   - Found `sessionHasNewContent` function that checks shadow branches
   - Discovered logs showing:
     - 17:59:39 - commit made, condensation happened
     - 17:59:58 - task checkpoint saved to `entire/755d3e8`
     - 18:00:37 - prepare-commit-msg says `has_new_content:false` (WRONG)
   - The mystery: shadow branch existed but hook said no new content
   - Possible issues: silent error handling at line 492-497 where any error = "no content"

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Complete the implementation of ENT-109: `--checkpoint` flag with tiered verbosity for `entire explain` command
   - Add git commit message display to verbose mode output
   - Move commit message to appear before the file list
   - Fix lint warnings (QF1012) about `fmt.Fprintf` usage
   - Debug why commit 09ea3c1 has a checkpoint ID (`e6d2bbd73e25`) from an unrelated old session

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach: write failing test, implement, verify
   - Tiered output verbosity: default (summary), verbose (+ files, prompts, commit), full (+ transcript)
   - Git checkpoint system: shadow branches (`entire/<base-commit>`), checkpoint IDs, condensation
   - Session state management: `BaseCommit`, `LastCheckpointID`, session state files
   - prepare-commit-msg and post-commit hooks for checkpoint linking
   - `Entire-Checkpoint` trailer in git commits

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/explain.go`** - Main implementation file
     - Added `findCommitMessageForCheckpoint` helper:
     ```go
     func findCommitMessageForCheckpoint(repo *git.Repository, checkpointID string) string {
         head, err := repo.Head()
         if err != nil {
             return ""
         }
         commitIter, err := repo.Log(&git.LogOptions{From: head.Hash()})
         if err != nil {
             return ""
         }
         defer commitIter.Close()
         const maxCommitsToSearch = 500
         count := 0
         for {
             commit, iterErr := commitIter.Next()
             if iterErr != nil {
                 break
             }
             count++
             if count > maxCommitsToSearch {
                 break
             }
             foundID, hasTrailer := paths.ParseCheckpointTrailer(commit.Message)
             if hasTrailer && foundID == checkpointID {
                 firstLine := strings.Split(commit.Message, "\n")[0]
                 return strings.TrimSpace(firstLine)
             }
         }
         return ""
     }
     ```
     - Updated `formatCheckpointOutput` signature and implementation:
     ```go
     func formatCheckpointOutput(result *checkpoint.ReadCommittedResult, checkpointID, commitMessage string, verbose, full bool) string {
         // ... header (checkpoint ID, session, timestamp, tokens, intent) ...
         
         // Verbose: add commit message, files, and prompts
         if verbose || full {
             // Commit message section (only if available)
             if commitMessage != "" {
                 sb.WriteString("\n")
                 fmt.Fprintf(&sb, "Commit: %s\n", commitMessage)
             }
             sb.WriteString("\n")
             // Files section
             // Prompts section
         }
         // Full: add transcript
     }
     ```
     - Fixed QF1012 lint warnings in `formatSessionInfo` and `formatCommitInfo` by using `fmt.Fprintf(&sb, ...)` instead of `sb.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(...))`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/explain_test.go`** - Tests for checkpoint output
     - `TestFormatCheckpointOutput_Verbose` - tests commit message display
     - `TestFormatCheckpointOutput_Verbose_NoCommitMessage` - tests no Commit section when empty
     - `TestFormatCheckpointOutput_Full` - tests commit message in full mode

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_hooks.go`** - Key file for bug investigation
     - Lines 217-221: Fallback to ALL sessions (the suspected bug):
     ```go
     // If no sessions match current HEAD, fall back to all sessions
     if len(currentSessions) == 0 {
         currentSessions = sessions
     }
     ```
     - Lines 492-497: Silent error handling in `sessionHasNewContent`:
     ```go
     ref, err := repo.Reference(refName, true)
     if err != nil {
         return false, nil // ANY error treated as "no content"
     }
     ```

   - **Session state files**: `/Users/alex/workspace/cli/.git/entire-sessions/`
     - Old session `2026-01-19-c2b51eb0-...` has `last_checkpoint_id: "e6d2bbd73e25"`
     - Current session `2026-01-21-0cf3db51-...` has `last_checkpoint_id: null`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Compilation errors with new function signature**: Updated all test calls to include the new `commitMessage` parameter
   - **Missing git import**: Added `"github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"` import for `findCommitMessageForCheckpoint`
   - **QF1012 lint warnings**: Fixed by replacing `sb.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(...))` with `fmt.Fprintf(&sb, ...)`

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Completed**: Base checkpoint explain implementation with tiered verbosity
   - **Completed**: Commit message display in verbose mode
   - **Ongoing**: Investigating why checkpoint ID from wrong session is being used
     - Found fallback logic that uses ALL sessions when no session matches HEAD
     - Analyzed logs showing discrepancy: content existed at 17:59:58 but hook said "no content" at 18:00:37
     - Possible causes: BaseCommit mismatch, silent error in repo.Reference(), session state not saved properly

6. All user messages:
   - "in verbose mode, we should show the git commit message. (do the normal dev process to add this please including TDD)"
   - "move the message up just before the file list?"
   - "what's causing these diagnostic issues? fmt/lint issues?"
   - "yeah let's do it"
   - "ok, so I am noting some weirdness. In one of _our commits_ 09ea3c1e2b76a240fadcd7c0594744be77348a94 (we did this just now), it is referencing checkpoint e6d2bbd73e25. That checkpoint seems...unrelated?"
   - "is this a timing problem?"
   - "our current claude session id is 0cf3db51-1c73-43bb-8d05-dc02739514a5 if that's helpful"
   - "so there's no way to get the correct checkpoint in this case...?"
   - "how can we be committing with nothing to condense? claude has done 2 commits without any prompts in between?"
   - "how big is the fix?"
   - "I don't think the reviewer would have been making commits. and as you note, the commits are nearly a minute apart. you're about to run out of context so let's compact and come at this fresh"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Debug and fix the checkpoint ID bug in prepare-commit-msg hook
   - Possible fixes discussed:
     - Option A: Remove fallback to all sessions (3 lines, simplest)
     - Option B: Add recency check (~5 lines)
     - Option C: Check ancestry instead of exact match (~10 lines)
     - Better error handling in `sessionHasNewContent` to distinguish "branch doesn't exist" from "error looking up branch"

8. Current Work:
   Investigating why commit `09ea3c1` has checkpoint ID `e6d2bbd73e25` from an unrelated old session. Key findings from logs:
   ```
   17:59:39 - commit 755d3e8, condensed, shadow branch entire/51a7ff0 deleted
   17:59:58 - task checkpoint saved to entire/755d3e8 (NEW CONTENT EXISTS)
   18:00:37 - prepare-commit-msg says has_new_content:false, reuses old checkpoint
   ```
   The mystery: shadow branch existed but hook said "no new content" 39 seconds later.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue investigating why `sessionHasNewContent` returned false when shadow branch `entire/755d3e8` existed. Focus on:
   - Whether session's `BaseCommit` was correctly set to `755d3e8`
   - Whether silent error handling at line 492-497 masked a real error
   - Consider adding logging/debugging to understand the exact state during the hook execution
   
   User's last message: "I don't think the reviewer would have been making commits. and as you note, the commits are nearly a minute apart. you're about to run out of context so let's compact and come at this fresh"

# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - One-off test script if no framework
   - MUST have before fixing
   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   **STOP and question fundamentals:**
   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
   - Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

   **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

   This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

**Related skills:**
- **superpowers:test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1)
- **superpowers:verification-before-completion** - Verify fix worked before claiming success

## Real-World Impact

From debugging sessions:
- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common

---

so I understand correctly, after step 1 the shadow branch is gone, but no new shadow branch exists because we don't have a user prompt interaction?

---

can a checkpoint exist with no prompt context?

I'd imagine the agent log has _some_ additions, just not user prompts...

---

what should be the correct behaviour here - new checkpoint, or just a commit that flies through with no checkpoint? that feels wrong to me as it's part of the work that's been done. we are missing something?

---

or are we just missing the events? (a hook...?)

---

and "no new content" is really "no new chat activity"; there was a code change clearly if there was a commit :|

---

and I'm also challenging the fact that the transcript is unchanged, we don't diff it, we are only going on the events we are watching

---

"if staged files overlap with Claude's work" <- I don't understand what you mean

---

huh. how is session.FilesTouched empty if claude is making the commit?

I've done zero manual file changes as part of this session

---

oh - is that triggered by me queuing a message in this cli interface? and why would lastCheckpointId be cleared...?

---

yeaaah? (I also think you've called root cause prematurely a couple of times now😂)

---

what was the commit that introduced this behaviour?

---

and a new one gets generated on the pre-commit hook yeah?

---

and this isn't a problem in auto I'm assuming?

how does this commit look if it's reusing the previous checkpoint id - it won't have the latest transcript or files_touched in the old checkpoint...

---

I think the reuse is for the scenario where the _user_ has made the additional commit and claude is dormant

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Session Start**: This is a continuation from a previous session. The summary indicated work was done on ENT-109 (`--checkpoint` flag for `entire explain`), tasks 1-15 were completed, and debugging of a checkpoint ID bug had begun.

2. **Initial Bug Description**: Commit `09ea3c1` had checkpoint ID `e6d2bbd73e25` from an old session (`2026-01-19-c2b51eb0`) instead of the current session (`2026-01-21-0cf3db51`).

3. **First Investigation - BaseCommit Drift**:
   - Found that when commits happen in quick succession, `BaseCommit` doesn't get updated
   - Post-commit returns early when "no new content" without updating `BaseCommit`
   - Subsequent commits have `HEAD != BaseCommit`, current session filtered out
   - Falls back to ALL sessions (lines 217-221 in manual_commit_hooks.go)
   - User called out premature "root cause" declaration

4. **Second Investigation - LastCheckpointID Clearing**:
   - Discovered current session has `last_checkpoint_id: null` while old session has `e6d2bbd73e25`
   - Found code that clears `LastCheckpointID` on every `UserPromptSubmit` (lines 703-709)
   - This means: Prompt → LastCheckpointID cleared → Claude works (no Stop yet) → Commit → no LastCheckpointID to reuse
   - User again noted premature root cause declaration

5. **Third Investigation - Checking the Design**:
   - The clearing was in the initial commit (`e72157d`) - original design
   - Test `REDACTED` explicitly tests this behavior
   - Design assumes: Prompt → Work → Stop → Commit → Prompt (clear) → Work → Stop → Commit
   - Doesn't handle: commits during active work (before Stop)

6. **User's Key Insights**:
   - "no new content" really means "no new chat activity" - but there WAS a code change (commit)
   - Transcript IS changing even without our watched events
   - We don't diff the transcript, only go by events we watch
   - The clearing on prompt is unnecessary since new checkpoint ID naturally replaces LastCheckpointID when new content is condensed
   - Reuse is valid when Claude is dormant, not when Claude has been working

7. **Proposed Solution**:
   - Check actual transcript line count vs `condensed_transcript_lines`
   - If transcript grew → need new checkpoint (Claude was working)
   - If transcript same → reuse is fine (Claude was dormant)
   - This checks source of truth, not events we happened to observe

Summary:
## Summary: Checkpoint ID Bug Investigation

### 1. Primary Request and Intent:
Debug why commit `09ea3c1` has checkpoint ID `e6d2bbd73e25` from an unrelated old session (`2026-01-19-c2b51eb0`) instead of the current session (`2026-01-21-0cf3db51`). The user wants to understand the root cause and find the correct fix.

### 2. Key Technical Concepts:
- **Shadow branches**: `entire/<base-commit>` stores checkpoint data before condensation
- **Condensation**: Post-commit moves shadow branch content to `entire/sessions` branch, deletes shadow branch
- **`LastCheckpointID`**: Stored in session state, meant for reusing checkpoint ID when user splits commits
- **`BaseCommit`**: Tracks which commit the session is based on, used to find shadow branch
- **`CondensedTranscriptLines`**: How many transcript lines have been captured in checkpoints
- **Event-driven checkpointing**: Checkpoints created on `Stop` and `Task` events only
- **Transcript file**: Lives at `~/.claude/projects/.../session.jsonl`, continuously grows as Claude works

### 3. Files and Code Sections:

**`cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_hooks.go`** - Core file with the bug

The clearing logic (lines 702-709) - clears LastCheckpointID on every new prompt:
```go
// Clear LastCheckpointID on every new prompt
// This is set during PostCommit when a checkpoint is created, and should be
// cleared when the user enters a new prompt (starting fresh work)
if state.LastCheckpointID != "" {
    state.LastCheckpointID = ""
    needSave = true
}
```

The fallback logic (lines 217-221) - falls back to ALL sessions:
```go
// If no sessions match current HEAD, fall back to all sessions
// (for backward compatibility with sessions created before BaseCommit tracking)
if len(currentSessions) == 0 {
    currentSessions = sessions
}
```

The reuse logic (lines 224-231):
```go
stagedFiles := getStagedFiles(repo)
for _, session := range currentSessions {
    if session.LastCheckpointID != "" &&
        (len(session.FilesTouched) == 0 || hasOverlappingFiles(stagedFiles, session.FilesTouched)) {
        checkpointID = session.LastCheckpointID
        break
    }
}
```

**Session state files examined:**

Current session (`2026-01-21-0cf3db51`):
```json
{
  "session_id": "2026-01-21-0cf3db51-1c73-43bb-8d05-dc02739514a5",
  "base_commit": "d719ff868f74214a369b8c2bef7a73957fc7f9de",
  "condensed_transcript_lines": 989,
  "last_checkpoint_id": null  // <-- THE PROBLEM
}
```

Old session (`2026-01-19-c2b51eb0`):
```json
{
  "session_id": "2026-01-19-c2b51eb0-d0e9-43cf-b431-42c05d49450b",
  "files_touched": ["cmd/entire/cli/explain.go", "cmd/entire/cli/explain_test.go", ...],
  "last_checkpoint_id": "e6d2bbd73e25"  // <-- Got incorrectly used
}
```

**Log analysis from** `/Users/alex/workspace/cli/.entire/logs/2026-01-21-0cf3db51-1c73-43bb-8d05-dc02739514a5.log`:
```
18:07:37 - checkpoint 102b7007badc, has_new_content:true, condensed
18:08:20 - checkpoint 102b7007badc, has_new_content:false (reused correctly)
18:09:06 - checkpoint e6d2bbd73e25, has_new_content:false (WRONG - old session!)
```

### 4. Errors and Fixes:
- **Premature root cause declarations**: User called out twice that I declared "root cause" too early. Each layer of investigation revealed deeper issues:
  1. First thought: `BaseCommit` drift when post-commit returns early
  2. Second thought: `LastCheckpointID` being null in current session
  3. Third thought: The clearing on `UserPromptSubmit` causes the null
  4. Actual issue: The design assumes events we don't actually track

### 5. Problem Solving:

**Bug flow identified:**
1. Commit made → `LastCheckpointID` set to `102b7007badc`
2. User sends new prompt → `LastCheckpointID` **cleared to null**
3. Claude works (no Stop event yet - subagents running)
4. User commits → current session has `LastCheckpointID: null`
5. Reuse logic can't use current session, falls back to ALL sessions
6. Old session has `LastCheckpointID: e6d2bbd73e25` with overlapping files
7. Old checkpoint ID incorrectly used

**Key insight from user:**
- "no new content" means "no events we're watching" - NOT "transcript unchanged"
- Current transcript: 1305 lines, `condensed_transcript_lines`: 989 = **316 lines uncaptured**
- We should check actual transcript growth, not rely on event-driven shadow branch

**User clarified reuse intent:**
- Reuse is correct when Claude is **dormant** (user making additional commits, nothing changed)
- Reuse is wrong when Claude has **worked** (transcript grew)

### 6. All User Messages:
1. "can we continue the debug?"
2. "using your skill?"
3. "as an aside, I also think we have a problem with the altered file list in metadata.json...but let's leave that for later"
4. "can a checkpoint exist with no prompt context? I'd imagine the agent log has _some_ additions, just not user prompts..."
5. "so I understand correctly, after step 1 the shadow branch is gone, but no new shadow branch exists because we don't have a user prompt interaction?"
6. "and 'no new content' is really 'no new chat activity'; there was a code change clearly if there was a commit :|"
7. "huh. how is session.FilesTouched empty if claude is making the commit? I've done zero manual file changes as part of this session"
8. "oh - is that triggered by me queuing a message in this cli interface? and why would lastCheckpointId be cleared...?"
9. "yeaaah? (I also think you've called root cause prematurely a couple of times now😂)"
10. "what was the commit that introduced this behaviour?"
11. "and a new one gets generated on the pre-commit hook yeah?"
12. "and this isn't a problem in auto I'm assuming? how does this commit look if it's reusing the previous checkpoint id - it won't have the latest transcript or files_touched in the old checkpoint..."
13. "I think the reuse is for the scenario where the _user_ has made the additional commit and claude is dormant"

### 7. Pending Tasks:
- Implement fix for checkpoint ID bug
- Write regression test
- Verify fix works
- (Noted for later: investigate files_touched in metadata.json issue)

### 8. Current Work:
Converging on the correct fix approach. The user has clarified the design intent:

**Reuse is valid when:** Claude is dormant, user is just making additional commits
**Reuse is invalid when:** Claude has been working (transcript grew since last condensation)

**Proposed solution:** Instead of relying on shadow branch existence (event-driven), check actual transcript:
```go
if currentTranscriptLines > session.CondensedTranscriptLines {
    // Claude has been working → need new checkpoint
    hasNewContent = true
} else {
    // Claude is dormant → reuse is fine
    // use LastCheckpointID
}
```

This makes the clearing on `UserPromptSubmit` irrelevant - we're checking actual state, not guessing based on events.

### 9. Optional Next Step:
Implement the fix that checks actual transcript line count against `condensed_transcript_lines` to determine if new content exists, rather than relying on shadow branch existence.

User's most recent message: "I think the reuse is for the scenario where the _user_ has made the additional commit and claude is dormant"

This clarified that:
- The transcript check is the right approach
- Reuse when `currentTranscriptLines == condensed_transcript_lines` (dormant)
- New checkpoint when `currentTranscriptLines > condensed_transcript_lines` (working)

let's continue the debug (use skill)

so if we are clearing the lastCheckpointId prior to a commit this is an issue (assumption)

do we also have an issue if we don't clear it and reuse the lastcheckpointId for a commit and the transcript _has_ changed?

---

clarification: Scenario B: Don't clear, but blindly reuse

there is no additional prompt in this sequence, as the lastCheckpointId isn't cleared?

---

it's not even the user committing, right?

---

I reckon this is getting a bit messy, so can we be VERY CLEAR about what the problem scenarios are, and file a linear bug? attach it to project Troy, Milestone R1

---

add problem 1 to the same card (we will take our changes to a new branch and reference the same issue)

---

isn't the chronology in problem 1 that a new prompt came in before the stop and cleared the lastCheckpointId?

---

Commit 2 is irrelevant in this scenario...?
