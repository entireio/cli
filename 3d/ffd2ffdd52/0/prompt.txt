# GitHub PR Review

## Overview

Technical mechanics for GitHub PR review workflows via `gh` CLI. Covers fetching review comments, replying to threads, creating/updating PRs.

**Companion skill:** For *how to evaluate* feedback, see `superpowers:receiving-code-review`. This skill covers *how to interact* with GitHub.

**Security:** Use fine-grained PAT with minimal permissions.

## Setup (One-Time)

### Fine-Grained PAT

Create at github.com -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens:

| Permission | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Pull requests | Read & Write |
| Contents | Read |

**Can't:** Delete repos, push code, delete branches, manage settings.

### Configure & Allowlist

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="github_pat_xxxx"
```

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(gh repo view:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr view:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr create:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr ready:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr edit:*)",
      "Bash(gh api repos/*/*/pulls/*/comments:*)",
      "Bash(gh api repos/*/*/pulls/*/comments/*/replies:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Quick Reference

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Get owner/repo | `gh repo view --json owner,name -q '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'` |
| Get PR number | `gh pr view --json number -q .number` |
| Get PR author | `gh pr view --json author -q .author.login` |
| Fetch all review comments | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments --paginate` |
| Get single comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}` |
| Reply to comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -f body="msg"` |
| Create PR | `gh pr create --title "T" --body "B" [--draft]` |
| Mark ready | `gh pr ready [number]` |
| Convert to draft | `gh pr ready --undo [number]` |
| Edit PR | `gh pr edit [number] --title "T" --body "B"` |

## Workflow: Respond to PR Review

### 1. Get repo info and PR details

```bash
owner_repo=$(gh repo view --json owner,name -q '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"')
pr_number=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
pr_author=$(gh pr view --json author -q .author.login)
```

### 2. Fetch and analyze threads

```bash
# Fetch all comments and group into threads, showing last author per thread
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments --paginate | jq 'sort_by([.in_reply_to_id // .id, .created_at]) | group_by(.in_reply_to_id // .id) | map({thread_id: (.[0].in_reply_to_id // .[0].id), path: .[0].path, line: (.[0].line // .[0].original_line), last_author: .[-1].user.login, last_body: .[-1].body[0:100], count: length})'
```

### 3. Filter to threads needing response

```bash
# Filter to threads where last_author != PR author
# Note: Use '| not' instead of '!=' to avoid shell escaping issues with !
... | jq --arg author "$pr_author" '[.[] | select(.last_author == $author | not)]'
```

For each thread needing response:
- Read the comment + file/line context
- Apply `superpowers:receiving-code-review` skill for evaluation
- Fix code and/or reply to thread

### 4. Commit fixes and push
- run the build, tests, linting as required
- commit the changes, noting the commit sha
- push the changes so they're visible
- We need to do this FIRST so we have the commit shas to put into the replies to the pr review

### 5. Re-fetch comment IDs (if rebased)

**Important:** If you rebased or force-pushed, comment IDs may have changed. Re-fetch the comment threads before replying:

```bash
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments --paginate | jq '...'
```

### 6. Reply to a thread

```bash
gh api repos/${owner_repo}/pulls/${pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123. [description of fix]"
```

### 7. Summarize and finish

After all threads addressed, ask if ready to mark PR ready for review.

**Note:** REST API doesn't expose "resolved" status. We infer "done" when PR author made last comment in thread.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Broad PAT permissions | Use fine-grained PAT with only Pull requests + Contents |
| Missing pagination | Always use `--paginate` for comment fetching |
| Top-level reply | Use `/comments/{id}/replies` endpoint, not `/comments` |
| Re-responding to threads | Skip threads where PR author made last comment |
| Forgetting to reply after fix | Always reply to confirm the fix was made |
| jq `!=` fails with shell error | Use `select(.x == "y" \| not)` instead of `select(.x != "y")` |
| 404 on reply after rebase | Comment IDs change after force-push/rebase. Re-fetch comments before replying |

# Code Review Reception

## Overview

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## The Response Pattern

```
WHEN receiving code review feedback:

1. READ: Complete feedback without reacting
2. UNDERSTAND: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. VERIFY: Check against codebase reality
4. EVALUATE: Technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. RESPOND: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. IMPLEMENT: One item at a time, test each
```

## Forbidden Responses

**NEVER:**
- "You're absolutely right!" (explicit CLAUDE.md violation)
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!" (performative)
- "Let me implement that now" (before verification)

**INSTEAD:**
- Restate the technical requirement
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back with technical reasoning if wrong
- Just start working (actions > words)

## Handling Unclear Feedback

```
IF any item is unclear:
  STOP - do not implement anything yet
  ASK for clarification on unclear items

WHY: Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.
```

**Example:**
```
your human partner: "Fix 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.

❌ WRONG: Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later
✅ RIGHT: "I understand items 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."
```

## Source-Specific Handling

### From your human partner
- **Trusted** - implement after understanding
- **Still ask** if scope unclear
- **No performative agreement**
- **Skip to action** or technical acknowledgment

### From External Reviewers
```
BEFORE implementing:
  1. Check: Technically correct for THIS codebase?
  2. Check: Breaks existing functionality?
  3. Check: Reason for current implementation?
  4. Check: Works on all platforms/versions?
  5. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?

IF suggestion seems wrong:
  Push back with technical reasoning

IF can't easily verify:
  Say so: "I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?"

IF conflicts with your human partner's prior decisions:
  Stop and discuss with your human partner first
```

**your human partner's rule:** "External feedback - be skeptical, but check carefully"

## YAGNI Check for "Professional" Features

```
IF reviewer suggests "implementing properly":
  grep codebase for actual usage

  IF unused: "This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
  IF used: Then implement properly
```

**your human partner's rule:** "You and reviewer both report to me. If we don't need this feature, don't add it."

## Implementation Order

```
FOR multi-item feedback:
  1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
  2. Then implement in this order:
     - Blocking issues (breaks, security)
     - Simple fixes (typos, imports)
     - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)
  3. Test each fix individually
  4. Verify no regressions
```

## When To Push Back

Push back when:
- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist
- Conflicts with your human partner's architectural decisions

**How to push back:**
- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference working tests/code
- Involve your human partner if architectural

**Signal if uncomfortable pushing back out loud:** "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:
```
✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
✅ "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ [Just fix it and show in the code]

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Thanks for catching that!"
❌ "Thanks for [anything]"
❌ ANY gratitude expression
```

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

**If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks":** DELETE IT. State the fix instead.

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:
```
✅ "You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
✅ "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

❌ Long apology
❌ Defending why you pushed back
❌ Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually and move on.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |
| Blind implementation | Verify against codebase first |
| Batch without testing | One at a time, test each |
| Assuming reviewer is right | Check if breaks things |
| Avoiding pushback | Technical correctness > comfort |
| Partial implementation | Clarify all items first |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction |

## Real Examples

**Performative Agreement (Bad):**
```
Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"
❌ "You're absolutely right! Let me remove that..."
```

**Technical Verification (Good):**
```
Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"
✅ "Checking... build target is 10.15+, this API needs 13+. Need legacy for backward compat. Current impl has wrong bundle ID - fix it or drop pre-13 support?"
```

**YAGNI (Good):**
```
Reviewer: "Implement proper metrics tracking with database, date filters, CSV export"
✅ "Grepped codebase - nothing calls this endpoint. Remove it (YAGNI)? Or is there usage I'm missing?"
```

**Unclear Item (Good):**
```
your human partner: "Fix items 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.
✅ "Understand 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before implementing."
```

## GitHub Thread Replies

When replying to inline review comments on GitHub, reply in the comment thread (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}/replies`), not as a top-level PR comment.

## The Bottom Line

**External feedback = suggestions to evaluate, not orders to follow.**

Verify. Question. Then implement.

No performative agreement. Technical rigor always.
