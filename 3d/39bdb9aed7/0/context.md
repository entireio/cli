Commit Message: Run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Prompts

### Prompt 1

run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Summary

My apologies, `docs/color.md` already details "Blue," and I misunderstood the instruction to "choose your color." Since "Blue" is covered, I'll now append content about "Red" to `docs/color.md`.
