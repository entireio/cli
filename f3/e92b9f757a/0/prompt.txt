Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wingman status notifications in agent terminal

## Context

Wingman status messages (review started, review pending) currently go to stderr, which is invisible in Claude Code's UI. The only visible wingman output is the `additionalContext` prompt injection when REVIEW.md is applied. The user wants informational `systemMessage` notifications so they can see what wingman is doing — not injected into the agent's context, just displayed in the terminal.

## Changes

### 1. Add `outputHookMessage` helper (`cmd/entire/cli/hooks.go`)

New function alongside the existing `outputHookResponse` and `outputHookResponseWithContextAndMessage`. Outputs a JSON hook response with only `systemMessage` — no `additionalContext`, so nothing gets injected into the agent's conversation.

```go
func outputHookMessage(message string) error {
    resp := hookResponse{SystemMessage: message}
    return json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).Encode(resp)
}
```

### 2. Stop hook: wingman status notification (`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go`)

Add `outputWingmanStopNotification(repoRoot string)` that checks wingman state and outputs a message. Call it at the end of `commitWithMetadata()` in both:
- The no-changes early return path (~line 297, before `return nil`)
- The normal return path (~line 448, before `return nil`)

Logic:
- If wingman not enabled or `ENTIRE_WINGMAN_APPLY` set → skip
- If lock file (`.entire/wingman.lock`) exists → review is running → `"[Wingman] Reviewing your changes..."`
- Else if REVIEW.md exists → review done, pending delivery → `"[Wingman] Review pending — will be addressed on your next prompt"`
- Otherwise → no message

The stop hook currently never writes to stdout. Adding a `systemMessage`-only JSON response is safe since Claude Code parses any JSON output from hooks.

### 3. Prompt-submit hook: review-in-progress notification (`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go`)

In `captureInitialState()`, the lock file check (lines 103-110) currently writes `"[wingman] Review in progress..."` to stderr only. Change to use `outputHookMessage` so the message appears in the agent terminal.

This runs only when there's NO REVIEW.md (the injection path returns early on line 99). Session initialization runs after and only touches disk/stderr, so outputting JSON before it is safe — no double-write risk.

## Files to modify

- `cmd/entire/cli/hooks.go` — Add `outputHookMessage` helper
- `cmd/entire/cli/hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` — Add stop hook notification function, update prompt-submit lock file message

## Verification

1. `mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci`
2. Manual: enable wingman, make changes, trigger stop hook — should see "[Wingman] Reviewing..." in agent terminal
3. Manual: with pending REVIEW.md, trigger stop hook — should see "[Wingman] Review pending..."
4. Manual: with lock file present, send a prompt — should see "[Wingman] Review in progress..."

commit this

push it

---

Update the documentation make sure there's no redundant parts in there, add a table for messaging and when they happen. Look at the PR review comments and see if there's anything valid in there. Adress them. Commit and push.

---

I like that the prompt structure is documented.

---

Run lint and fix the issues, then push.

golangci-lint does fire a few times

Let's investigate first why every "Stop" now says "  ⎿  Stop says: [Wingman] Reviewing your changes...    " but I don't see anything in the logs?

Stop hook says   ⎿  Stop says: [Wingman] Reviewing your changes...  but I don't see anything in the logs, which means that nothing is actually getting reviewed. Check the timeline when the problem got introduced and fix it.
