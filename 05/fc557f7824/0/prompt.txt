I just got this during a rebase:

❯ git rebase main
Link this commit to Agent session context? [Y/n] n
Link this commit to Agent session context? [Y/n] n
Rebasing (23/25)

I think we should somehow prevent this from happening. Basically I think the rebase had commits without a trailer, but since the session was still active the hooks tried to link them. This shouldn't be a thing.

---

can we add tests for this?
