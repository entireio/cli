In this branch we've added tests to setup_test.go.  They're hard to read.  Let's instead replace our expectations with literal multiline strings, nice and obvious.

OK, that's part of it.  I'd also like to remove all instances of "does the result contain A? Does the result *not* contain B?"  

Instead, i'd like all those assertions replaced with a single comparison to what the result should be, literally.

now do the same thing in stanza_test.go
