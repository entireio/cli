### Prompt 1

Right now the gemini agent will print this when being enable: 

❯ entire enable --agent gemini
Installed 12 hooks for Gemini CLI - Google's AI coding assistant - This is a work in progress

Let's replace " - This is a work in progress" with " (Preview)" and then we should add a section to the README.md in #Configuration explaining how to enable gemini, can you propose something?

### Prompt 2

can you double check that `--force` on enable actually removes the hooks for gemini?
