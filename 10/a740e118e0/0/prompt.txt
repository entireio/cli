  description: "Reviewer checking [feature]",
  prompt: "
    Read and follow the instructions in .claude/agents/reviewer.md

    Requirements folder: https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/102

    Your task:
    1. Read .claude/agents/reviewer.md for your role and process
    2. Read https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/102/README.md for requirements context
    3. Read any existing review-NN.md files to understand previous feedback
    4. Review branch changes: git diff main...HEAD -- . ':!.entire'
    5. Systematically check against the review checklist
    6. Write review to https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/102/review-NN.md (increment NN from last review)
