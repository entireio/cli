can you look at the changes in this branch and let me know what effort it is to fix this: 

The humanModified calculation at line 235 uses min(totalUserAdded, totalUserRemoved) to estimate modifications, but this doesn't distinguish between user modifications to agent code vs. user modifications to their own code. When a user modifies their own previously-added lines (e.g., removes 3 of their accumulated lines and adds 3 different ones), the formula at line 256 (agentLinesInCommit := max(0, totalAgentAdded-pureUserRemoved-humanModified)) incorrectly subtracts these self-modifications from the agent's line count. This causes agent contributions to be undercounted when users edit their own code between or after checkpoints.

---

how would you track line ownership?

---

how do line hashes work if you have the same line in the file multiple time, like for example `  }` will be there multiple times

---

could we create a summary of the options for this and what we went with (I'd go with option 4 now as a simple improvement) but keep it in the repo. So could we do a ADR doc in docs/architecture too

---

Lets do the implementation too

---

can we rewrite the ADR so it's more like how the whole line attribution feature works now? Like not starting from current bug but write it in the context of the PR/Branch which adds the whole feature. Also don't give it a number and it needs no date or status in the file

---

The CalculatedAt timestamp uses time.Now() which includes the local timezone. For consistency with other timestamps in the codebase that serialize to JSON (like incremental checkpoints), consider using time.Now().UTC() instead. While this is consistent with the existing CreatedAt field in CommittedMetadata (line 329), using UTC would be more consistent with incremental checkpoint timestamps and avoid timezone-related issues when comparing timestamps across systems.

Can we do this, but can you first check if we really use UTC consistently?

Missing UserAddedPerFile field causes lost per-file tracking

Medium Severity

The session.PromptAttribution struct is missing the UserAddedPerFile field that exists in strategy.PromptAttribution. When session state is saved via sessionStateFromStrategy, the UserAddedPerFile map is lost because the destination type lacks this field. This causes estimateUserSelfModifications to always return 0, incorrectly attributing user self-modifications as agent modifications, resulting in under-counted agent lines and inflated agent modification counts.

---

Duplicated comment line in attribution function

Low Severity

Lines 366 and 367 contain an identical duplicated comment: "Track per-file user additions for accurate modification tracking". One of these duplicate lines appears to be accidentally repeated.

---

Low Severity

When reading files from the worktree in calculatePromptAttributionAtStart, binary files are not filtered (lines 1016-1017 use os.ReadFile without null-byte checking). However, getFileContent used for tree content returns empty string for binary files (null-byte check at line 90). This inconsistency causes diffLines(referenceContent, worktreeContent) to compare empty string against raw binary data, producing garbage line counts that inflate UserLinesAdded when binary files are changed.

---

question: doesn't git know if it's a binary file?

---

I think this was just fixed, right: The UserAddedPerFile field is not being converted between session.PromptAttribution and strategy.PromptAttribution. This field is critical for accurate user self-modification tracking (see docs/architecture/attribution.md). Without this conversion, the per-file tracking data will be lost when session state is saved/loaded, causing incorrect attribution calculations in multi-checkpoint scenarios.

Add UserAddedPerFile to the session.PromptAttribution struct and include it in both conversion functions (sessionStateToStrategy and sessionStateFromStrategy).

---

in manual_commit_attribution: The code uses a heuristic (min-based approach) to split accumulated user edits between agent-touched and non-agent files, but the necessary data already exists in accumulatedUserAddedPerFile to make this split precisely.

Instead of lines 235-236:

accumulatedToNonAgentFiles := min(allUserEditsToNonAgentFiles, accumulatedUserAdded)
accumulatedToAgentFiles := accumulatedUserAdded - accumulatedToNonAgentFiles
Calculate precisely:

var accumulatedToAgentFiles, accumulatedToNonAgentFiles int
for filePath, added := range accumulatedUserAddedPerFile {
    if slices.Contains(filesTouched, filePath) {
        accumulatedToAgentFiles += added
    } else {
        accumulatedToNonAgentFiles += added
    }
}
This eliminates a source of potential inaccuracy and makes the calculation deterministic rather than heuristic-based.

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked about fixing a bug in the humanModified calculation at line 235 that doesn't distinguish between user modifications to agent code vs user modifications to their own code.

2. **Analysis Phase**: I examined `manual_commit_attribution.go` and `manual_commit_attribution_test.go` to understand the attribution system.

3. **ADR Creation**: Created an ADR document at `docs/architecture/adr-001-attribution-line-ownership.md` documenting 4 options for line ownership tracking. User asked to rewrite it as a feature design doc without the ADR number/date/status format.

4. **Implementation of Option 4 (Per-File Pool Heuristic)**:
   - Extended `PromptAttribution` struct with `UserAddedPerFile map[string]int`
   - Updated `CalculatePromptAttribution()` to populate per-file tracking
   - Updated `CalculateAttributionWithAccumulated()` to use per-file data with `estimateUserSelfModifications()`
   - Added new tests

5. **Rewrote ADR**: Renamed to `docs/architecture/attribution.md` as a feature design doc

6. **UTC Timestamp Fix**: User pointed out inconsistent timestamp usage. Fixed `time.Now()` to `time.Now().UTC()` in:
   - `checkpoint/committed.go:329` - CommittedMetadata.CreatedAt
   - `strategy/manual_commit_attribution.go:292` - InitialAttribution.CalculatedAt

7. **Missing UserAddedPerFile in session package**: Fixed the conversion between `strategy.PromptAttribution` and `session.PromptAttribution` by:
   - Adding `UserAddedPerFile` to `session.PromptAttribution`
   - Updating both `sessionStateToStrategy` and `sessionStateFromStrategy` conversion functions

8. **Duplicate comment fix**: Removed duplicate comment line at lines 366-367

9. **Binary file detection inconsistency**: Fixed inconsistent binary detection by:
   - Using `file.IsBinary()` in `getFileContent()`
   - Using `binary.IsBinary(bytes.NewReader(data))` for worktree files
   - Added import for `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/utils/binary`

10. **Precise calculation fix**: User pointed out we can use exact per-file data instead of heuristic. Changed lines 235-237 from min-based heuristic to precise calculation using `accumulatedUserAddedPerFile`. This caused a test failure that needs investigation.

Current state: Test `TestCalculateAttributionWithAccumulated_UserEditsNonAgentFile` is failing - expects 42.9% but got 33.3%. The test doesn't have `UserAddedPerFile` in its `PromptAttribution`, so the new precise calculation can't find the per-file data.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user asked to analyze and fix a bug in the attribution line ownership tracking system where `humanModified` calculation incorrectly subtracts user self-modifications from agent lines. The fix required implementing per-file tracking to distinguish between user modifications to agent code vs their own code. Additional requests included:
   - Creating an architecture document (ADR, then rewritten as feature doc)
   - Fixing UTC timestamp consistency
   - Fixing missing `UserAddedPerFile` field in session state conversion
   - Removing duplicate comment
   - Using git's binary detection instead of manual null-byte checking
   - Using precise per-file calculation instead of heuristics

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Line ownership tracking for attribution (agent vs user lines)
   - LIFO heuristic: users modify their own recent additions before agent code
   - Per-file tracking via `UserAddedPerFile map[string]int`
   - go-git's `binary.IsBinary()` for binary file detection
   - Session state round-trip conversion between `strategy` and `session` packages
   - UTC timestamp consistency for serialized data

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `docs/architecture/attribution.md`
     - New feature design document explaining the attribution system
     - Documents the per-file pool heuristic approach and why it was chosen

   - `cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_types.go`
     - Added `UserAddedPerFile` field to `PromptAttribution` struct:
     ```go
     type PromptAttribution struct {
         CheckpointNumber  int            `json:"checkpoint_number"`
         UserLinesAdded    int            `json:"user_lines_added"`
         UserLinesRemoved  int            `json:"user_lines_removed"`
         AgentLinesAdded   int            `json:"agent_lines_added"`
         AgentLinesRemoved int            `json:"agent_lines_removed"`
         UserAddedPerFile  map[string]int `json:"user_added_per_file,omitempty"`
     }
     ```

   - `cmd/entire/cli/session/state.go`
     - Added matching `UserAddedPerFile` field to `session.PromptAttribution`:
     ```go
     UserAddedPerFile map[string]int `json:"user_added_per_file,omitempty"`
     ```

   - `cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit.go`
     - Updated both conversion functions to include `UserAddedPerFile`:
     ```go
     // In sessionStateToStrategy
     result.PromptAttributions = append(result.PromptAttributions, PromptAttribution{
         CheckpointNumber:  pa.CheckpointNumber,
         UserLinesAdded:    pa.UserLinesAdded,
         UserLinesRemoved:  pa.UserLinesRemoved,
         AgentLinesAdded:   pa.AgentLinesAdded,
         AgentLinesRemoved: pa.AgentLinesRemoved,
         UserAddedPerFile:  pa.UserAddedPerFile,
     })
     ```

   - `cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_attribution.go`
     - Added `estimateUserSelfModifications()` function
     - Updated `CalculatePromptAttribution()` to populate `UserAddedPerFile`
     - Updated `CalculateAttributionWithAccumulated()` to use per-file tracking
     - Changed to precise calculation (most recent change):
     ```go
     // Separate accumulated edits by file type using per-file tracking data.
     var accumulatedToAgentFiles, accumulatedToNonAgentFiles int
     for filePath, added := range accumulatedUserAddedPerFile {
         if slices.Contains(filesTouched, filePath) {
             accumulatedToAgentFiles += added
         } else {
             accumulatedToNonAgentFiles += added
         }
     }
     ```
     - Changed `getFileContent()` to use `file.IsBinary()`:
     ```go
     isBinary, err := file.IsBinary()
     if err != nil || isBinary {
         return ""
     }
     ```
     - Fixed `CalculatedAt` to use UTC: `CalculatedAt: time.Now().UTC()`

   - `cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_hooks.go`
     - Added imports for `bytes` and `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/utils/binary`
     - Updated binary detection in worktree reading:
     ```go
     isBinary, binErr := binary.IsBinary(bytes.NewReader(data))
     if binErr == nil && !isBinary {
         content = string(data)
     }
     ```

   - `cmd/entire/cli/checkpoint/committed.go`
     - Fixed `CreatedAt` to use UTC: `CreatedAt: time.Now().UTC()`

   - `cmd/entire/cli/strategy/manual_commit_attribution_test.go`
     - Added tests for `estimateUserSelfModifications`
     - Added `TestCalculateAttributionWithAccumulated_UserSelfModification`
     - Added `TestCalculateAttributionWithAccumulated_MixedModifications`
     - Added `TestCalculatePromptAttribution_PopulatesPerFile`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Linter error on unchecked error return**: `binary.IsBinary` error not checked
     - Fixed by checking: `if binErr == nil && !isBinary`
   - **Current failing test**: `TestCalculateAttributionWithAccumulated_UserEditsNonAgentFile` expects 42.9% but got 33.3%
     - Cause: Test's `PromptAttribution` doesn't include `UserAddedPerFile`, so precise calculation finds no per-file data for file2.go
     - Status: **Not yet fixed**

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved the core bug where user self-modifications incorrectly reduced agent attribution
   - Solved session state round-trip losing `UserAddedPerFile` data
   - Solved binary file detection inconsistency between tree and worktree reads
   - Solved UTC timestamp inconsistency
   - Currently troubleshooting: Test failure after switching from heuristic to precise per-file calculation

6. All user messages:
   - "can you look at the changes in this branch and let me know what effort it is to fix this: The humanModified calculation at line 235..."
   - "how would you track line ownership?"
   - "how do line hashes work if you have the same line in the file multiple time, like for example `  }` will be there multiple times"
   - "could we create a summary of the options for this and what we went with... in docs/architecture too"
   - "Lets do the implementation too"
   - "can we rewrite the ADR so it's more like how the whole line attribution feature works now? Like not starting from current bug but write it in the context of the PR/Branch which adds the whole feature. Also don't give it a number and it needs no date or status in the file"
   - "The CalculatedAt timestamp uses time.Now() which includes the local timezone... Can we do this, but can you first check if we really use UTC consistently?"
   - "Missing UserAddedPerFile field causes lost per-file tracking" (bug report)
   - "Duplicated comment line in attribution function" (bug report)
   - "When reading files from the worktree in calculatePromptAttributionAtStart, binary files are not filtered..." (bug report)
   - "question: doesn't git know if it's a binary file?"
   - "I think this was just fixed, right: The UserAddedPerFile field is not being converted..."
   - "in manual_commit_attribution: The code uses a heuristic (min-based approach) to split accumulated user edits between agent-touched and non-agent files, but the necessary data already exists in accumulatedUserAddedPerFile to make this split precisely..."

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix the failing test `TestCalculateAttributionWithAccumulated_UserEditsNonAgentFile` - the test needs `UserAddedPerFile` populated in its `PromptAttribution`

8. Current Work:
   Changed lines 235-237 in `manual_commit_attribution.go` from a heuristic-based calculation to precise per-file calculation. The change was:
   ```go
   // OLD (heuristic):
   accumulatedToNonAgentFiles := min(allUserEditsToNonAgentFiles, accumulatedUserAdded)
   accumulatedToAgentFiles := accumulatedUserAdded - accumulatedToNonAgentFiles
   
   // NEW (precise):
   var accumulatedToAgentFiles, accumulatedToNonAgentFiles int
   for filePath, added := range accumulatedUserAddedPerFile {
       if slices.Contains(filesTouched, filePath) {
           accumulatedToAgentFiles += added
       } else {
           accumulatedToNonAgentFiles += added
       }
   }
   ```
   This caused test failure because `TestCalculateAttributionWithAccumulated_UserEditsNonAgentFile` doesn't have `UserAddedPerFile` in its test data.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Fix the failing test by adding `UserAddedPerFile: map[string]int{"file2.go": 2}` to the test's `PromptAttribution`. The user's last request was:
   > "in manual_commit_attribution: The code uses a heuristic (min-based approach) to split accumulated user edits between agent-touched and non-agent files, but the necessary data already exists in accumulatedUserAddedPerFile to make this split precisely."
   
   The implementation is done, but the test needs updating to include the per-file data it was previously inferring via heuristic.

I'd like to do some proper tests with a real repo and a real claude calls, can you help me do that? Like write a script that creates a repo, then run prompts ("add a script that returns a random number"), then adds a file, run another prompt updating that added file and do that all in one script run? Using claude --model haiku and a prompt directly (so it's not interactive)

---

ah, right! can we change the script so it's using `go run cmd/..` so we are always using the latest code?

=== Step 13: Attribution Analysis ===
No initial_attribution in metadata

Checking debug logs for attribution issues:

Files touched (agent-modified):
main.py

=== Step 14: Check prompt attributions ===
Files in checkpoint directory:
29/25028bf55f/content_hash.txt
29/25028bf55f/context.md
29/25028bf55f/full.jsonl
29/25028bf55f/metadata.json
29/25028bf55f/prompt.txt

=== Step 15: List sessions ===
unknown command "session" for "entire"

Did you mean this?
        version


=== Test Complete ===
Test repo location: /var/folders/gz/h7sjhvz13cb0gcrzzcncqtyw0000gn/T/tmp.N6JIukK8D2

What was tested:
  1. Agent added get_random_number() to main.py
  2. User created utils.py (non-agent file)
  3. Agent modified utils.py (now agent-touched)
  4. User edited main.py (agent-touched file)
  5. Commit with attribution tracking
  6. Metadata inspection on entire/sessions branch

Expected attribution behavior:
  - main.py: agent added lines, user added 2 lines after
  - utils.py: user created (6 lines), agent added format_percentage()
  - Agent % should reflect agent lines vs total new lines

Repo kept for inspection. To clean up: rm -rf /var/folders/gz/h7sjhvz13cb0gcrzzcncqtyw0000gn/T/tmp.N6JIukK8D2

Useful inspection commands:
  cd /var/folders/gz/h7sjhvz13cb0gcrzzcncqtyw0000gn/T/tmp.N6JIukK8D2
  git log entire/sessions --oneline
  git show entire/sessions:<checkpoint-path>/metadata.json | jq .
