### Prompt 4

in manual_commit we have a feature that asks the user if he wants to link the commit ("Link this commit to Claude session context?") can we add the current active prompt there?

### Prompt 5

Can you change it to "You have an active <agent name> session which started with "<prompt>"" and then new line with the question to link as so far

### Prompt 6

ok maybe like this then: 
You have an active Claude Code session. Prompt:
...prompt...
Link this commit to Claude Code session context? [Y/n]

### Prompt 7

Wrap the prompt in "

### Prompt 8

We need to make sure that once we add more agents this won't say "Claude Code" but actually uses the agent name. is this an easy change?

### Prompt 9

this change: 
-               state, err = s.initializeSession(repo, sessionID)
+               // Agent type empty here - will be set by hook if this is a new session
+               state, err = s.initializeSession(repo, sessionID, "")

Can you explain when that value would be set then?

### Prompt 10

yes, preserve what was there
