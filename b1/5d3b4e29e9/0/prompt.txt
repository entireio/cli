can you look at the changes in this branch, I got this feedback, let me know what you think before doing anythning:

Redundant default case duplicates Claude Code case

Low Severity

The default case in BuildCondensedTranscriptFromBytes is an exact copy of the AgentTypeClaudeCode/AgentTypeUnknown/"" case (same 4 lines of code). This duplication means any future fix to the Claude parsing path needs to be applied in two places, risking inconsistency. The explicit case already handles all known non-Gemini agent types, so the default branch is effectively unreachable with current constants — and even if it were reachable, it does the same thing. Simplifying by making the Claude logic the default (or removing the separate default block) would eliminate the duplication.
