# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

we used yesterday the test-repo skill and after that I get the following error when starting claude, and I think it's related to the fake claude sessions that we create as part of the skill, can you take a look? This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). The promise rejected with the reason:
RangeError: Invalid Date
    at toISOString (unknown)

### Prompt 2

yes

### Prompt 5

### Prompt 6

hmm, I just checked for example: ~/.claude/projects/-Users-soph-Work-entire-devenv-cli and none of the files has a date in front

### Prompt 7

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### Prompt 8

sorry, continue

### Prompt 9

can you create the logs as the harness would do and then I can validate?

### Prompt 10

can you write it to a folder in ~/.claude/projects as the harness would? I then want to start a second claude code and see it's fixed

### Prompt 11

ok, works. great
