Can you review the changes in this branch, especially around existing sessions after this would be applied. Like what happens if I resume an old session with the old format, or have an active session and with the old format and now update and a hook fires, will it figure out how to handle this? And on top of that: I think even more code can be removed now if we don't mess with the raw session ids anymore.

---

let's do Add migration logic in handleSessionStart() to check for existing old-format sessions

---

why is one method having the agent in the name the other not?

---

I also meant:   - handleSessionStart() in hooks_claudecode_handlers.go
  - handleGeminiSessionStart() in hooks_geminicli_handlers.go

---

yeah I feel the prefix is redundant

---

ok, if that's the case we need to make "handleSessionStart" -> "handleClaudeCodeSessionStart"

---

can you commit both changes we did in individual commits for me?

High Severity

The handleGeminiBeforeAgent function uses input.SessionID directly instead of calling currentSessionIDWithFallback like Claude Code's equivalent handler (parseAndLogHookInput) and Gemini's own handleGeminiAfterAgent. For legacy sessions with date-prefixed IDs (e.g., "2026-01-20-abc123"), this causes a session ID mismatch: BeforeAgent captures pre-prompt state with "abc123" while AfterAgent tries to load it with "2026-01-20-abc123", breaking token usage calculation and new file detection.
