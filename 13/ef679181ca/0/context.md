Commit Message: Run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Prompts

### Prompt 1

run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Summary

`docs/color.md` persists as untracked. I'll confirm my working directory, then re-attempt `git add docs/color.md` from the full path. If that fails, I'll check `.gitignore` for exclusions.
