Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Walk parent chain to detect hidden commands for telemetry/version check

## Context

Cobra's `cmd.Hidden` only reflects the command itself — children don't inherit it. When `entire hooks git post-commit` runs, the leaf `post-commit` has `Hidden: false` even though parent `hooks` is `Hidden: true`. Telemetry and version checks incorrectly run for these internal commands.

## Plan

Replace `cmd.Hidden` with a parent-walk loop in `root.go`'s `PersistentPostRun` (the single gate for both telemetry and version check).

### Change in `cmd/entire/cli/root.go` (line 42-45)

Before:
```go
// Skip for hidden commands
if cmd.Hidden {
    return
}
```

After:
```go
// Skip for hidden commands (walk parent chain — Cobra doesn't propagate Hidden)
for c := cmd; c != nil; c = c.Parent() {
    if c.Hidden {
        return
    }
}
```

### Test in `cmd/entire/cli/root_test.go`

Add a test that constructs a command tree with a hidden parent and a non-hidden leaf, calls `NewRootCmd()`, and verifies `PersistentPostRun` returns early. Or more practically: test the behavior via the telemetry path using a table-driven approach.

## Verification

```bash
mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci
```
