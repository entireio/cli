Commit Message: Run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Prompts

### Prompt 1

run an agent that creates a color file inside docs, choose your color

## Summary

`docs/color.md` is untracked despite my modification. This implies it wasn't initially under version control, so my appending effectively "created" it for Git. To fulfill the user's request of "creating a color file inside docs" and ensure it's tracked, I'll `git add docs/color.md`.
