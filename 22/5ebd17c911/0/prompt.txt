can you run multiple agents reviewing the changes in the branch and also check if the approach is a best practice used by other clis installing git hooks?

Let's do these first: 

  1. Flatten the install branching logic — The three interleaved conditionals with a dangling if at line 169 are hard to follow. Simpler approach: (1) back up if needed, (2) chain if backup exists. Two sequential decisions instead of 6 code paths.

  2. Remove scanForMovedHooks — YAGNI. Handles a speculative scenario (another tool renaming our hooks to .pre-husky) that is unlikely and harmless if it occurs. Removes ~112 LOC including tests.

  3. Extract test setup helper — The 8-12 line git repo setup block is repeated 10 times. A initTestRepo(t) helper would save ~72 lines and make tests scannable.

1. Chained hook exit codes silently swallowed — If the backed-up commit-msg hook returns non-zero (e.g., commitlint rejecting a message), the chain call doesn't propagate the failure for all hook types consistently. The architecture reviewer noted this is actually correct for the current hooks (exit codes flow
  through naturally since the chain call is the last command), but it's worth verifying for pre-push where stdin consumption could be an issue.

What are our options here?

then can we look at  2. Silent data loss when backup already exists — If a non-Entire hook exists AND a .pre-entire backup already exists (from a previous install), the second custom hook is silently overwritten with no warning. Consider adding a stderr warning.
