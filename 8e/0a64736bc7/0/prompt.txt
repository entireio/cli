not as a comment, but as a document attached to the issue directly. you've attached it to the project...

hmm, I was able to do it through the UI -> https://linear.app/entirehq/document/task-list-5055e5808598

Generate a PR title and description based on the work done in this session. 

  Instructions:
  1. Review the conversation history to understand:
     - What the user asked for
     - What was implemented
     - Key decisions and trade-offs made
     - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved

  2. Run `git diff main...HEAD` to confirm the actual file changes

  3. Generate:
     - A concise PR title (50-72 chars, imperative mood)
     - A PR description (use markdown) with:
       - ## Summary (2-4 bullet points based on what was discussed and implemented)
       - ## Test plan (how to verify the changes)

  Prioritize the conversation context over just the git diff - the discussion captures the "why" and intent, not just the "what".

  Format the output as markdown:
  
```
  Title:

  # Summary

  - <bullet 1>
  - <bullet 2>

---

  # Test plan

  - <step 1>
  - <step 2>
```

  Do not create any files or make any changes. Just output the PR title and description.
