### Prompt 4

I think we have a bug with the `entire resume` command. If you have a branch and then merge in main, the latest commit(s) might not contain any trailers, so `entire resume` says it couldn't find anything. Can we look at the commits that are only part of this branch somehow?

### Prompt 5

Can we distinguish between the case "there are newer commits that are also in the default branch" and "there are newer commits that are only in the local branch"? for the first we don't need force if the first commit after commits from other branches has a trailer
