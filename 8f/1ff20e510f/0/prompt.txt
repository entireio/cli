can you check: what would happen on rewind for a gemini checkpoint, would we run the right code with the right logs to the right place or is this still claude centric?

---

yeah let's do the fix for 1 first

---

ok, let's fix the ending next, what would you propose?

---

yes, let's do that

---

now handle: 

  2. .gemini/ directory not protected during rewind (MEDIUM)

  common.go:191 defines only claudeDir = ".claude" for skip/protect lists. During rewind file deletion, .gemini/ (which may contain settings.json) is not protected and could be deleted if it wasn't present at checkpoint time.
