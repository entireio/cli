can you look at the changes in the branch and also figure out when this issue was introduced and show me the commit, can you then also go to it's checkpoint and summarize the session log that lead to this change?

---

But the fixes of that session are still intact or did we break anything that was intented to be fixed before? Or is the issue that was tried to fix still open?

---

can you check if it's worth tracking the PendingCheckpointID logic in CLAUDE.md or in docs/architecture for future reference?

---

yes

---

Now in this context we had an internal discussion that currently multiple commits in a single prompt should be part of the same checkpoint id. Can you research if this fix completely changed that or only fixed an edge case?

---

Looking at the current implementation: Is it easier from a complexity of code point of view to condense when agent stops happen or at each commit? You can ultrathink

---

ok, with that knowledge, can we start from scratch (make a new branch from main soph/single-commit-per-checkpoint) and change it?
