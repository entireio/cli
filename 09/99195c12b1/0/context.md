# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

commit and push

### Prompt 2

next problem: I would have expected to see more checkpoints on this branch. is entire explain session-framed still?

### Prompt 3

read ENT-109 from linear

### Prompt 4

ah, we already had ENT-53 and ENT-59 for the wider piece - `entire explain` as a list view will fold into the interactive list piece.

however, for testing....a branch-focused view of what is available on this branch (and distinct from the main protected branch) is useful

### Prompt 5

it can even be the default without the --flag

### Prompt 6
