Implement the following plan:

# Move shell completion prompt from `enable` to new `curl-bash-post-install` command

## Context

The CLI's `enable` command currently includes an optional shell-completion installation prompt. Now that we have an `install.sh` script (curl|bash installer) that calls `entire curl-bash-post-install` after installing the binary, we need a dedicated hidden command for that post-install step. For now it should just do the interactive completion prompt. We'll remove the completion logic from `enable`.

## Changes

### 1. Create `newCurlBashPostInstallCmd()` in `cmd/entire/cli/setup.go`

Add a new hidden cobra command:
- `Use: "curl-bash-post-install"`
- `Hidden: true`
- `RunE` calls `promptShellCompletion(cmd.OutOrStdout())`
- Errors from `promptShellCompletion` are non-fatal (print note, return nil) — same pattern used today in `runEnableInteractive`

### 2. Register the command in `cmd/entire/cli/root.go`

Add `cmd.AddCommand(newCurlBashPostInstallCmd())` alongside the other commands.

### 3. Remove shell completion logic from `enable`

In `setup.go`:
- **`runEnableWithStrategy`**: Remove the `if setupShell { ... }` block (lines 243-249)
- **`runEnableInteractive`**: Remove the entire completion block (lines 353-365)
- **`newEnableCmd`**: Remove the `setupShell` variable, the `--setup-shell` flag registration (line 96), and the `setupShell` parameter from calls to `runEnableWithStrategy` and `runEnableInteractive`
- Update function signatures of `runEnableWithStrategy` and `runEnableInteractive` to drop the `setupShell` parameter

### 4. Keep shared helpers in place

These functions are used by both the old and new code and stay where they are in `setup.go`:
- `promptShellCompletion` — used by the new command
- `setupShellCompletionNonInteractive` — keep for now (could be useful later)
- `isCompletionConfigured`
- `appendShellCompletion`
- `shellCompletionComment`

## Files to modify

- `cmd/entire/cli/setup.go` — add new command function, remove completion from enable flows
- `cmd/entire/cli/root.go` — register new command

## Verification

```bash
mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci
```

Then manually test:
- `entire curl-bash-post-install` prompts for shell completion
- `entire enable` no longer prompts for or mentions shell completion
- `entire help` does not show `curl-bash-post-install`

One more thing, when installing Zsh completions, let's also add `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit` before our `source ...`

---

That case statement looks duplicated.  Do we need all the logic in promptShellCompletion and setupShellCompletionNonInteractive to be duplicated?  Let's try and simplify.

OK, not bad.  I don't quite like e259b8e though - it gets rid of the informative output.  I'd like to bring that part back.  If the completions are already present, give that feedback like before, and if we can't determine the user's current shell even though they wanted us to install completions, print a warning to that effect before exiting.
